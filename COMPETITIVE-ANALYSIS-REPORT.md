# Inclusiv Competitive Intelligence Report
## Web Accessibility Market Analysis - January 2026

---

## Executive Summary

The web accessibility market is experiencing unprecedented growth driven by regulatory enforcement, legal pressure, and the approaching European Accessibility Act (EAA) deadline of June 28, 2025. The market is projected to reach **$1.89 billion by 2034**, with a 37% surge in ADA lawsuits in H1 2025.

**Critical Market Insight**: Overlay-based solutions (AccessiBe, UserWay, EqualWeb) are facing an existential crisis. AccessiBe received a **$1 million FTC fine** in April 2025, and both AccessiBe and UserWay face active class action lawsuits. **25% of all ADA lawsuits in 2024 targeted websites using overlay widgets**.

This creates a massive opportunity for Inclusiv's authentic, code-level compliance approach.
