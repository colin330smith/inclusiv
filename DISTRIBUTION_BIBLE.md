## Reddit Posting Strategy

### Rules to Avoid Bans
1. **80/20 Rule**: 80% value comments, 20% posts
2. **Karma First**: Build 100+ karma in each sub before posting
3. **No Direct Links Initially**: Say "check my profile" or "DM for link"
4. **Native Content**: Adapt message to each community
5. **Timing**: Post 9-11am EST (peak US) or 2-4pm GMT (peak EU)
6. **Engage**: Reply to EVERY comment within 2 hours

### Post Templates by Type

**Value Post (Best Conversion)**
```
Title: I analyzed 500 websites for accessibility - here's what I found

Body:
Ran accessibility scans on 500 random sites. Results:

- 83% fail color contrast (WCAG 1.4.3)
- 67% missing alt text
- 45% have empty form labels
- 38% can't be navigated by keyboard
- 22% have no skip links

The EAA deadline passed June 28. Fines up to €100K.

Most issues take <1 hour to fix. Happy to share the tool I used (free, no signup).

[Don't link - let people ask]
```

**Question Post (High Engagement)**
```
Title: How are you handling EAA compliance for client sites?

Body:
Agency owner here. Getting more questions from EU clients about accessibility.

Current process is manual axe-devtools audits but it's slow.

What tools/processes are you using? Looking for something I can scale across 50+ client sites.
```

**AMA Post (Authority Building)**
```
Title: I've done 200+ accessibility audits - AMA about WCAG/EAA compliance

Body:
Been doing web accessibility work for 3 years. Built a scanner tool.

Happy to answer questions about:
- Most common issues and quick fixes
- EAA requirements
- Platform-specific problems (WordPress, Shopify, etc.)
- How to prioritize fixes

Ask away.
