🛠️ **Platform-specific fixes** - Copy-paste code for your CMS

📧 **Full report via email** - Detailed breakdown + prioritized fixes

Built for businesses who need to get compliant fast, not accessibility experts.

**First Comment:**
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built Inclusiv because I saw too many small businesses panicking about the EAA deadline without knowing where to start.

Most accessibility tools are built for developers and compliance officers. Inclusiv is built for business owners who just want to know: "Am I going to get fined, and what do I need to fix?"

Try it free - no signup required for a basic scan. Would love your feedback!

1/ 🚨 166 days until the European Accessibility Act deadline.

If your website isn't accessible, you could face €100,000 in fines.

I built a free scanner that checks your site in 30 seconds. Here's what you need to know: 🧵

2/ The EAA requires ALL websites selling to EU customers to be WCAG 2.1 AA compliant by June 28, 2025.

This includes:
- E-commerce sites
- Service providers
- B2B platforms
- Any business with EU customers

3/ Most businesses don't know they're non-compliant until it's too late.

Common issues:
- Missing alt text on images

- Keyboard navigation broken
- Missing form labels

4/ I built @InclusivDev to solve this.

✅ Free 30-second scan
