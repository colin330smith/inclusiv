**Tagline:** AI-powered accessibility scanner for EAA compliance

**Description:**
The European Accessibility Act is now in force. If your website serves EU customers, you need to be WCAG 2.1 AA compliant or face fines up to EUR 100,000.

Inclusiv scans your website, finds accessibility issues, and gives you AI-powered code fixes you can copy-paste. No more guessing what "insufficient color contrast" means or how to fix it.

**Key features:**
- Instant accessibility scan (free, no signup)
- AI-generated code fixes for each issue
- EAA compliance certificate when you pass
- Continuous monitoring to stay compliant

Built for developers and non-technical teams who need to get compliant fast.

**First Comment:**
Hey PH! We built Inclusiv because the EAA deadline just passed and 96% of websites still have accessibility issues.

Most accessibility tools just tell you what's wrong. We show you exactly how to fix it with copy-paste code snippets.

Try the free scan - no signup required. Would love your feedback!

## Hacker News - Show HN

**Title:** Show HN: Open-source accessibility scanner with AI-powered fixes

**Post:**
I built an accessibility scanner that doesn't just find issues - it tells you exactly how to fix them.

The European Accessibility Act just went into effect (June 28, 2025). If your site serves EU customers and isn't WCAG 2.1 AA compliant, you can face fines up to EUR 100K.

Most tools give you cryptic messages like "WCAG 2.1.1 Keyboard - Fail". Ours gives you:
- The exact element with the issue
- Why it matters for users
- Copy-paste code to fix it

Free scan at https://tryinclusiv.com - no signup, instant results.

Built with Next.js, uses axe-core for scanning, and GPT-4 for generating fix suggestions.

Would love feedback from the HN community, especially on:
1. What accessibility issues trip you up most?
2. Would you pay for continuous monitoring?

Most accessibility tools tell you "color contrast insufficient" and leave you to figure it out. I built something that shows you exactly what to change.

Free scan at tryinclusiv.com - no signup. Would love feedback from fellow devs.

The EAA just went into effect in Europe so figured this might help some of you with EU clients.
