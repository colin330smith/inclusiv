**Title:** I built a free EAA/WCAG accessibility scanner - 30 second scans, no signup

**Body:**
Hey r/webdev,

The EAA deadline hit June 28, 2025 and a lot of sites are scrambling. I built a free tool that scans any website for WCAG 2.1 AA and EAA compliance in 30 seconds.

**What it does:**
- Instant accessibility score (0-100)
- Detects your platform (WordPress, Shopify, React, etc.)
- Gives you copy-paste code fixes for every issue
- No signup required for basic scans

Just enter any URL at tryinclusiv.com and get results immediately.

Built with Next.js 15, axe-core for scanning, and Supabase for the backend. Happy to answer any technical questions.

Would love feedback from the community - what features would make this more useful for your workflow?

**Title:** Free tool: Check your site's WCAG 2.1 AA compliance in 30 seconds

**Body:**
Created a free accessibility scanner at tryinclusiv.com that tests against WCAG 2.1 AA criteria.

**Features:**
- Tests color contrast, alt text, heading structure, form labels, keyboard navigation, ARIA
- Platform-specific fixes (WordPress PHP, Shopify Liquid, etc.)
- No account needed
- PDF reports for sharing with clients/teams

With EAA now in effect, figured this might help smaller teams who can't afford expensive enterprise tools.

Feedback welcome - especially from accessibility professionals on what criteria to prioritize.

The European Accessibility Act started enforcement June 28, 2025. Fines can hit €100K.

I built a free scanner at tryinclusiv.com that:

Already scanned 500+ sites. Most common issues are color contrast and missing alt text - usually quick fixes.

## Hacker News

**Title:** Show HN: Free EAA/WCAG accessibility scanner – 30s scans, no signup

**Body:**
I built a free web accessibility scanner after seeing companies panic about the EAA deadline (June 28, 2025).

Site: https://tryinclusiv.com

How it works:
1. Enter any URL
2. Get WCAG 2.1 AA compliance score in ~30 seconds
3. See every issue with severity + copy-paste fix

Tech stack: Next.js 15, axe-core, Supabase, Vercel

Why I built it: Most accessibility tools are either expensive enterprise software or browser extensions that don't give actionable fixes. Wanted something that a solo dev or small team could use to get compliant quickly.

The scanner detects your CMS (WordPress, Shopify, Squarespace, etc.) and tailors the fix recommendations.

Free tier: 3 scans/month
Paid: $29/mo unlimited

Would love feedback, especially on false positives or missing criteria.

🚨 The EAA deadline has passed. Is your website compliant?

The European Accessibility Act started enforcement on June 28, 2025. If your business sells products or services to EU customers online, you're required to meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.

Non-compliance can result in fines up to €100,000.

I built a free tool to help: tryinclusiv.com

✅ Scan any website in 30 seconds
✅ Get a compliance score
✅ See every issue with severity levels
✅ Get copy-paste code fixes
✅ No signup required

Most sites have fixable issues:
- Color contrast problems (83% of sites)
- Missing image alt text
- Unlabeled form fields
- Poor heading structure

These typically take hours, not weeks, to remediate.

If you're in digital marketing, web development, or run an online business selling to Europe - I'd recommend running a quick check.

Happy to answer questions about EAA requirements in the comments.
