        <div class="body">
            <p>Hi Alo Yoga Team,</p>
            <p>I ran an accessibility audit on aloyoga.com and found severe compliance issues:</p>
            <p><strong>Accessibility Score: 48/100</strong><br>
            <strong>Critical Violations: 21</strong></p>
            <p>This represents significant legal exposure. E-commerce ADA lawsuits are up 37% in 2025. Fashion Nova paid $5M+ to settle similar issues.</p>
            <p>I built Inclusiv to help brands identify and fix these issues before they become lawsuits. Free scan at tryinclusiv.com.</p>
            <p>Would your team be open to reviewing the specific violations?</p>
            <p>Best regards,<br>Colin<br>Inclusiv<br>tryinclusiv.com</p>
