Title: I built a free WCAG accessibility scanner - now giving lifetime access to first 50 users for $199

Hey r/webdev,

Quick backstory: I spent 5 months building an accessibility scanner after seeing how many sites fail basic WCAG checks. The EAA is now being enforced in Europe (€100K fines) and ADA lawsuits in the US hit 5,000+ last year.

The scanner is free to use: tryinclusiv.com

But today I'm doing something different - offering lifetime access to the full platform (normally $499/mo) for a one-time $199 to the first 50 people.

What you get:
- Unlimited site scans
- Full issue reports with code fixes
- Continuous monitoring
- Priority support forever

Why? I need 50 real users to give feedback and build case studies. You get lifetime access at 97% off.

Free scanner (no purchase needed): tryinclusiv.com

Happy to answer questions below.

## OBJECTION RESPONSES (For Comments)

**"Why lifetime? Seems unsustainable"**
"Great question - I need 50 real users for feedback and case studies. It's an investment in growth. After 50, it goes back to $499/mo."

**"Is this a scam?"**
"Totally understand the skepticism. The free scanner works without payment - try it first. I'm Colin [last name], been building in public. Happy to jump on a call if you want to verify."

**"Why so cheap?"**
"I'm at $0 MRR and need to prove the model works. Early adopters get the best deal. This won't last."

**"What if you shut down?"**
"Fair concern. Lifetime means as long as we're running. I'm committed to this for the long haul - just raised [X] / bootstrapping with [X] runway. But I understand if that's a dealbreaker."
