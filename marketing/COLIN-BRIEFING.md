## TLDR

Everything is ready. I just need:
1. **Stripe link** ($199 lifetime)
2. **Resend verification** (for cold emails)
3. **You to post** (or give me social access)

Then we launch everything simultaneously.

## YOUR 3 ACTIONS

- Copy the link
```

### 2. Verify Resend (10 min)
```

```

## THEN I TAKE OVER

Once you've done those 3 things:

1. I'll send cold emails to all 20 leads
2. I'll monitor and draft responses to comments
3. I'll track conversions in Stripe

---

## FILE LOCATIONS

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| All social posts | `BLITZ-TODAY.md` |
| Cold emails | `COLD-EMAIL-BLAST.md` |
| Lead database | `CLEAN-LEADS.csv` |
| Launch checklist | `LAUNCH-CHECKLIST.md` |
| Master summary | `MASTER-SUMMARY.md` |

---

## THE MATH

```
20 leads × cold email → ~2-3 customers
Reddit posts × 4 → ~10-20 customers if traction
HN front page → ~15-25 customers if hit
Twitter/LinkedIn → ~2-5 customers
Network blast → ~5-10 customers

REALISTIC TOTAL: 20-40 customers
REVENUE: $4,000 - $8,000

STRETCH (if viral): 50+ customers = $10,000+
```

---

## WHEN YOU'RE READY

Just message me:
- "Stripe link is: [URL]"
- "Resend is verified"
- "I posted to Reddit"

And I'll handle the rest.

**LET'S GET THAT $10K. 🚀**
