## INCLUSIV VS OVERLAYS (accessiBe, UserWay, AudioEye)

| Feature | Inclusiv | Overlay Tools |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| **Approach** | Fix actual code | Add JavaScript widget |
| **WCAG Compliance** | Real compliance | Cosmetic changes |
| **Lawsuit Protection** | Fixes root issues | Lawsuits cite overlay users |
| **Performance Impact** | None (scan only) | Adds page weight |
| **User Experience** | Native, fast | Widget can be clunky |
| **Developer-Friendly** | Yes (code fixes) | No code access |
| **Price** | $199 lifetime | $500-2000/year |
| **Dependency** | None | Requires widget active |

### Key Talking Points

**"But overlays are easier"**
```
Overlays add a band-aid. They don't fix the underlying issues.

Recent lawsuits specifically mention overlay users. The argument: "If you knew you had issues (hence the overlay), why didn't you fix them?"

We identify issues AND give you the exact code to fix them. Real fixes = real compliance.
```

**"accessiBe is bigger/more established"**
```
Size doesn't mean better approach.

The National Federation of the Blind and other advocacy groups have publicly criticized overlay solutions. Multiple lawsuits have been filed against companies USING overlays.

Our approach: Fix the code. It's what accessibility experts recommend.

## INCLUSIV VS MANUAL AUDITS

| Feature | Inclusiv | Manual Audit |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Time to Results** | 30 seconds | 2-4 weeks |
| **Cost** | $199 once | $5,000-50,000 |
| **Repeatability** | Unlimited | One-time |
| **Continuous Monitoring** | Yes | No |
| **Code Fixes Included** | Yes | Sometimes |
| **Expertise Required** | None | Need auditor |

### Key Talking Points

**"But manual audits are more thorough"**
```
For initial compliance, yes - a human auditor catches nuances.

But for ongoing compliance? You need continuous monitoring. Every code change can introduce new issues.

Many clients use both: Manual audit for baseline, Inclusiv for ongoing monitoring.

$199 vs $5,000+ is also a factor for most businesses.

## INCLUSIV VS FREE TOOLS (WAVE, Lighthouse, axe DevTools)

| Feature | Inclusiv | Free Tools |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Scanning** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Issue Identification** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Code Fixes** | ✅ Platform-specific | ❌ General guidance |
| **Continuous Monitoring** | ✅ Yes | ❌ Manual only |
| **Dashboard/Reports** | ✅ Yes | ❌ Browser only |
| **Historical Tracking** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Team Collaboration** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Priority Support** | ✅ Yes | ❌ Community |

### Key Talking Points

**"Free tools exist"**
```
Absolutely. We're built on axe-core ourselves - same engine.

The difference:

Free tools tell you WHAT's wrong.
We tell you HOW to fix it - with code specific to your platform.

Free tools are point-in-time.
We monitor continuously and alert when new issues appear.

Free tools are for developers.
We're for businesses who need compliance without the learning curve.

It's the difference between a spell checker and Grammarly. Same underlying tech, different value prop.

## INCLUSIV VS BUILDING IN-HOUSE

| Feature | Inclusiv | In-House |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Development Time** | 0 hours | 100-500 hours |
| **Maintenance** | Included | Ongoing |
| **WCAG Updates** | Automatic | Manual |
| **Cost** | $199 once | $10K-50K+ dev time |
| **Time to Value** | Immediate | Months |

### Key Talking Points

**"We'll build our own"**
```
You could! But consider:

1. Dev time: 100-500 hours to build a good scanner
2. Maintenance: WCAG updates, browser changes, platform updates
3. Expertise: Need accessibility specialists to build well
4. Opportunity cost: Your devs could be building features

At $199 lifetime, we're probably cheaper than a single dev sprint.

Unless accessibility scanning IS your business, it's better to buy than build.
