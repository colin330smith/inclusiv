## OUTREACH SCRIPTS

### LinkedIn Connection Request (300 char limit)
Hi [Name], I noticed [Company] is in the fashion e-commerce space - the #1 target for ADA lawsuits (5,000+ in 2025). Happy to share a free accessibility scan. No strings attached. -Colin, Inclusiv

### Contact Form Message
Subject: Accessibility Compliance Alert - [Company]

Hi,

Given the 37% increase in ADA website lawsuits this year (5,000+ filed in 2025), I wanted to reach out to [Company].

Fashion/apparel e-commerce is the #1 targeted industry, and Shopify stores represent 32% of all cases.

I'd like to offer a free accessibility scan at tryinclusiv.com - takes 30 seconds, shows exactly what needs fixing before it becomes a legal issue.

87 million Americans have disabilities. Making your site accessible protects you legally and opens a massive market.

Would you be interested in a complimentary scan?

Best,
Inclusiv Team

### Cold Email (For verified contacts)
Subject: [Company] - Your competitors got sued for this

Hi [Name],

Fashion Nova paid $5M+ to settle their ADA website lawsuit. In 2025, 5,000+ e-commerce sites have been sued.

Fashion/apparel brands are the #1 target. Shopify stores represent 32% of all cases.

I ran a quick scan on [company].com and found [X] accessibility issues that could expose you to litigation.

Want to see the full report? It's free - tryinclusiv.com

Best,
Colin

P.S. - 46% of ADA lawsuits are against repeat defendants. Once you're on the plaintiff attorney radar, they keep coming back.
