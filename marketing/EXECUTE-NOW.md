**BODY:**

Hi Alo Yoga Team,

I ran a WCAG 2.1 accessibility scan on aloyoga.com and wanted to share concerning results:

Accessibility Score: 48/100
Critical Issues: 21

Top issues found:
- 11 links missing accessible names (screen reader users can't navigate)
- Color contrast failures making text hard to read
- Form elements without labels (checkout accessibility issues)

With 5,000+ ADA website lawsuits filed in 2025 (37% increase YoY), and fashion e-commerce as the #1 target, this exposure is significant. Fashion Nova's $5M+ settlement shows the stakes.

I'd be happy to share the full report - no strings attached. You can also run a free scan yourself at tryinclusiv.com (30 seconds).

Would your engineering team be interested in seeing the detailed breakdown?

Best regards,
Colin

## 3. CHUBBIES - Score 0/100 (102 Critical Issues) ⚠️ EXTREME

### Email Contact:
**TO:** support@chubbies.com
**SUBJECT:** URGENT: chubbiesshorts.com - 102 Critical Accessibility Violations

**BODY:**
```
Hi Chubbies Team,

I need to flag something urgent regarding chubbiesshorts.com:

Accessibility Score: 0/100
Critical Violations: 102

This is one of the most severe scores I've seen. With 5,000+ ADA lawsuits filed against e-commerce sites in 2025, this level of exposure is significant.

For context:
- Fashion Nova paid $5M+ to settle their ADA case
- 46% of lawsuits target repeat defendants
- Shopify stores represent 32% of all cases

I'm not trying to alarm - I'm trying to help before plaintiffs' attorneys find these issues first.

Would your engineering team be open to reviewing the specific violations? Happy to share the full scan - tryinclusiv.com runs a free audit in 30 seconds.

Best regards,

Hi HiSmile Team,

I ran an accessibility audit on hismileteeth.com and found severe compliance issues:

Accessibility Score: 0/100
Critical Violations: 134

This represents significant legal exposure. E-commerce ADA lawsuits are up 37% in 2025, with celebrity/influencer brands increasingly targeted.

Fashion Nova paid $5M+ in their settlement. With 134 violations, the exposure here is even more severe.

I built Inclusiv to help brands identify and fix these issues before they become lawsuits. Free scan at tryinclusiv.com.

Hi Pangaia Team,

I ran a WCAG accessibility scan on pangaia.com:

As a sustainability-focused brand, accessibility aligns with your inclusive values. Currently, 35 issues are blocking users with disabilities from fully experiencing your site.

## CLOSING SCRIPT (When They Respond)

**If they ask for the report:**
"Absolutely! Here's a live link to scan your site: tryinclusiv.com - just enter your URL. Takes 30 seconds. I can also walk you through the results and show you exactly how to fix each issue. When works for a 15-minute call?"

**If they ask about pricing:**
"We have plans starting at $497/month that include continuous monitoring + a remediation roadmap. But honestly, let's look at the scan first - you might have fewer issues than expected. Can I show you the dashboard in a quick call?"

**If they're skeptical:**
"Totally understand. 5 minutes - I'll share my screen, run a live scan, and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about. If it's not valuable, I'll be the first to say so. Fair?"
