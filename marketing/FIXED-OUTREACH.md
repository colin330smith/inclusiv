## NEW LINKEDIN CONNECTION REQUESTS (300 chars)

### Harish Bhatt - Alo Yoga
```
Hi Harish - saw your work scaling Alo's digital platform. Quick question: have you looked at accessibility lately? 87M Americans have disabilities - that's a massive untapped market. Happy to share insights from auditing fashion e-commerce sites.
```

### Emma Grede - Good American
```
Hi Emma - huge fan of Good American's inclusive sizing mission. Noticed an opportunity to extend that inclusivity to customers with disabilities (87M Americans). Happy to share a quick accessibility audit - no strings attached.
```

### Tom Montgomery - Chubbies
```
Hi Tom - love what you've built at Chubbies. Quick heads up: ran an accessibility scan and found some low-hanging fruit that could open up 87M Americans with disabilities as customers. Happy to share the report.
```

## NEW EMAIL TEMPLATES (Value-First)

### Subject Lines (A/B Test)
- "Quick accessibility win for [Company]"
- "[Company] + 87M new potential customers"
- "Accessibility opportunity at [Company]"

### Email Body - Alo Yoga (Harish)
```
Hi Harish,

I help fashion e-commerce brands unlock the disability market (87M Americans, $490B spending power).

Ran a quick scan on aloyoga.com and found some accessibility gaps - nothing catastrophic, but definitely leaving money on the table.

The good news: most issues are straightforward engineering fixes. Screen reader navigation, color contrast, form labels - stuff your team can knock out quickly.

Want me to send over the detailed report? It shows exactly what to fix and prioritizes by impact. No sales pitch, just useful data.

Best,
Colin
tryinclusiv.com

P.S. - Given Alo's focus on wellness and inclusivity, accessible design aligns perfectly with your brand values.
```

### Email Body - Good American (Emma)
```
Hi Emma,

Good American's mission around inclusive sizing is brilliant - extending that same thinking to digital accessibility could open up 87M Americans with disabilities.

I scanned goodamerican.com and found a few accessibility gaps. Nothing dramatic, but fixing them would:
1. Open your brand to customers who literally can't shop your site today
2. Strengthen your inclusive brand positioning
3. Get ahead of the increasing regulatory focus on digital accessibility

Happy to send the detailed breakdown - shows exactly what to prioritize and why.

Best,
Colin

### Email Body - Chubbies (Tom)
```
Hi Tom,

Quick one - ran an accessibility scan on chubbiesshorts.com and found quite a few issues (102 total).

Before you worry: most are quick fixes. Screen reader labels, keyboard navigation, contrast ratios. Your dev team can probably knock out the critical ones in a sprint.

The upside: 87M Americans have disabilities. That's a lot of potential customers who can't fully use your site today.

Want the detailed report? Happy to walk your team through it.

Best,
Colin
