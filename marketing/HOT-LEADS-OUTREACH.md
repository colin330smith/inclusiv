## ALO YOGA - Score 48 (CRITICAL)
**Decision Makers:**
- Harish Bhatt, VP Engineering, Digital & Cloud
- Mahesh K. Murthy, VP Engineering, Digital

### LinkedIn Connection Request (300 chars)
Hi Harish, I scanned aloyoga.com and found 21 critical WCAG issues - score of 48/100. Fashion e-commerce is #1 ADA lawsuit target. Happy to share the full report and show exactly how to fix before it becomes legal exposure.

### Follow-Up Message (After Connection)
Thanks for connecting Harish!

I ran a detailed accessibility scan on aloyoga.com. Here's what I found:

**Score: 48/100** (anything under 70 is lawsuit territory)

**Critical Issues (21 total):**
- 11 links without discernible text - screen readers can't navigate
- 4 list items outside proper list markup
- 3 color contrast failures - unreadable for low vision users
- 1 form element without label - blind users can't checkout

**Why this matters:**
Fashion Nova paid $5M+ in their ADA settlement. 5,000+ lawsuits filed in 2025 alone. Shopify stores represent 32% of all cases.

I built Inclusiv specifically to help brands like Alo fix these issues before plaintiffs' attorneys come calling.

Would 15 minutes work this week to walk through the report? Or check tryinclusiv.com - takes 30 seconds to see for yourself.

Best,

Hi Alo Yoga Team,

I ran a WCAG 2.1 accessibility scan on aloyoga.com and wanted to share concerning results:

**Accessibility Score: 48/100**
**Critical Issues: 21**

Top issues found:
- 11 links missing accessible names (screen reader users can't navigate)
- Color contrast failures making text hard to read
- Form elements without labels (checkout accessibility issues)

With 5,000+ ADA website lawsuits filed in 2025 (37% increase YoY), and fashion e-commerce as the #1 target, this exposure is significant. Fashion Nova's $5M+ settlement shows the stakes.

I'd be happy to share the full report - no strings attached. You can also run a free scan yourself at tryinclusiv.com (30 seconds).

Would your engineering team be interested in seeing the detailed breakdown?

Best regards,

## GOOD AMERICAN - Score 60 (AT RISK)
**Decision Makers:**
- Emma Grede, Co-Founder + CEO

### LinkedIn Connection Request (300 chars)
Hi Emma, congrats on Good American's success. I scanned goodamerican.com and found 14 critical accessibility issues - ARIA errors and contrast problems. Given the surge in ADA lawsuits targeting fashion, wanted to flag before it becomes legal exposure.

### Follow-Up Message (After Connection)
Thanks for connecting Emma!

I ran an accessibility audit on goodamerican.com. Here's what I found:

**Score: 60/100** (70+ is generally safe territory)

**Critical Issues (14 total):**
- 7 color contrast failures - some text unreadable for low vision customers
- 7 ARIA attribute errors - assistive technology issues

**The business case:**
- Fashion brands are #1 ADA lawsuit target
- 5,000+ lawsuits filed in 2025 (up 37%)
- 87 million Americans have disabilities = massive untapped market
- Fashion Nova paid $5M+ to settle

Beyond legal protection, fixing these issues opens Good American to customers who literally can't shop your site today.

Would 15 minutes work to walk through the report? I built Inclusiv to help brands like yours identify and fix these issues before they become legal exposure - or lost customers.

Best,
Colin

Hi Chubbies Team,

I need to flag something urgent regarding chubbiesshorts.com:

This is one of the most severe scores I've seen. With 5,000+ ADA lawsuits filed against e-commerce sites in 2025, this level of exposure is significant.
