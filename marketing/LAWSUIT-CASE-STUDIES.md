## USING THESE IN SALES

### Opening Hook
```
"Did you know Fashion Nova paid over $5 million to settle an accessibility lawsuit? And they're not alone - 5,000+ ADA cases were filed last year."
```

### Fear Bridge
```
"The plaintiffs use automated scanners - the same kind of tool we use. If you have issues, they'll find them. The question is whether you fix them first or pay to fix them later."
```

### Cost Comparison
```
"Average settlement is $25K-$100K. We're $199. Even if there's a 1% chance you get targeted, the math makes sense."
```

### Urgency Close
```
"The EAA is now enforced. ADA lawsuits hit record numbers. The risk isn't theoretical anymore."
```

| Major class action | $1M-10M+ |

**The math is simple: Fix it for $199 or pay $5,000-$100,000+ later.**
