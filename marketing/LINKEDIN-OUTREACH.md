## FOLLOW-UP INMAILS (After Connection Accepted)

### InMail 1: Value Delivery (Send within 24 hours)
```
Thanks for connecting, [Name]!

As promised - I ran a detailed accessibility scan on [company website].

Here's what I found:
- [X] critical WCAG violations
- [X] images missing alt text
- [X] color contrast failures
- [X] form accessibility issues

These are exactly what ADA plaintiff attorneys look for when targeting fashion e-commerce sites.

Would you be open to a quick 15-min call to walk through the findings? Or I can just send over the full report - whichever is easier.

Best,
Colin
Founder, Inclusiv
```

### InMail 2: Industry Context (Day 3-5)
```
Hi [Name],

Following up on that accessibility scan for [Company].

Quick context that might be relevant:

- 5,000+ ADA website lawsuits filed in 2025 (37% increase YoY)
- Fashion/apparel is the #1 targeted industry
- Average settlement: $25K-$75K + mandatory remediation
- [Competitor] was sued last month for similar issues

The good news: most of the issues we found on [company website] are fixable in days, not months.

Happy to share the prioritized fix list if helpful. Just takes 15 minutes to walk through.

Best,
Colin
```

### InMail 3: Specific Issue Deep Dive (Day 7)
```
[Name],

One specific issue from the [Company] scan I wanted to highlight:

Your checkout flow has [X] form accessibility violations. This means:
1. Screen reader users can't complete purchases
2. It's a WCAG 2.1 AA Level violation (mandatory under ADA)
3. It's also costing you conversions - ~15% of users abandon due to accessibility issues

The fix is actually straightforward: [brief technical description]

We've helped [X] fashion brands fix this exact issue. Average time: 2-3 hours of dev work.

Worth a quick call to discuss?

Colin

## COLD INMAILS (Premium Accounts - No Connection)

### Cold InMail A: Direct & Data-Driven
```
Subject: [Company] Accessibility Scan Results

Hi [Name],

I ran an accessibility scan on [company website] and found [X] issues that could expose [Company] to ADA litigation.

Quick facts:
- Fashion e-commerce: #1 target for ADA lawsuits (5,000+ in 2025)
- Average settlement: $25K-$75K + mandatory fixes
- Your site scored [X]/100 on our compliance checker

I'm not trying to sell you anything - just thought you'd want to know before a plaintiff attorney finds the same issues.

Full report is free: tryinclusiv.com/scan

Happy to jump on a 15-min call to walk through it if that's easier.

Colin Smith
Founder, Inclusiv
```

### Cold InMail B: Peer Approach (For CTOs/VPs)
```
Subject: Fellow engineer heads up on ADA compliance

[Name],

One engineer to another - wanted to flag something.

I've been building accessibility tools for e-commerce and ran a scan on [Company]. Found some gaps that could cause headaches:

- [X] images without alt text
- [X] form label issues
- [X] keyboard navigation problems

Nothing unfixable, but the kind of stuff ADA plaintiff attorneys specifically look for when targeting fashion brands.

Built a free scanner at tryinclusiv.com if you want to dig deeper. Or happy to send over the full findings directly.

No pitch - just trying to help fellow tech leads get ahead of compliance issues before they become problems.

Colin
```

### Cold InMail C: For Founders/CEOs
```
Subject: Quick heads up for [Company]

Hi [Name],

Impressive what you've built at [Company].

Quick heads up that might save you some headaches: I ran your site through an accessibility checker and found [X] issues that could expose you to ADA litigation.

Fashion e-commerce is the #1 target - 5,000+ lawsuits filed in 2025 alone. Average settlement: $25K-$75K, plus mandatory remediation.

Built tryinclusiv.com specifically to help brands like yours catch these issues before lawyers do.

Happy to share the full scan results if useful - takes 30 seconds and it's free.

Best,
Colin Smith

## COMPANY-SPECIFIC MESSAGES

### ALO YOGA (Score: 48 - WORST)
**Connection Request for Harish Bhatt:**
```
Harish, your work scaling digital at Sephora was impressive. At Alo, I noticed some accessibility gaps (21 critical issues) that could impact both UX and legal exposure. Happy to share findings from our scan.
```

**Follow-up InMail:**
```
Thanks for connecting, Harish!

Given your background at Sephora (where accessibility is taken seriously), wanted to share what I found on aloyoga.com:

- Overall Score: 48/100 (below industry average)
- 21 critical WCAG violations
- 47 images missing alt text on homepage alone
- Checkout form accessibility issues

These are all fixable - most in a sprint or two. The bigger risk is that plaintiff attorneys are actively scanning fashion e-commerce sites for exactly these patterns.

Worth 15 minutes to walk through? I can show you exactly what they're flagging and how to prioritize fixes.

Best,
Colin
```

### GOOD AMERICAN (Score: 60)
**Connection Request for Emma Grede:**
```
Emma, incredible what you've built with Good American and SKIMS. As an accessibility-focused founder, I noticed some compliance gaps on goodamerican.com. Happy to share - always good to catch these before lawyers do.
```

**Follow-up InMail:**
```
Thanks for connecting, Emma!

I know your time is incredibly valuable, so I'll keep this brief:

Ran a detailed accessibility scan on goodamerican.com. Found 14 critical issues that could impact both customer experience and legal exposure.

The good news: these are all fixable quickly. The concerning news: fashion e-commerce is facing a 37% increase in ADA lawsuits, and these are exactly the issues being targeted.

Would love 15 minutes to walk you through what we found. Or I can just send over the report if that's easier.

Best,
Colin
Founder, Inclusiv
```

### SKIMS
**Connection Request for Devin K Miller:**
```
Devin, fellow CTO here. Noticed your work scaling tech at SKIMS, Good American, and Fashion Nova. Accessibility compliance is becoming critical for fashion e-commerce. Happy to share some relevant findings.
```

**Follow-up InMail:**
```
Thanks for connecting, Devin!

Given your track record scaling tech at fashion brands (SKIMS, Good American, Fashion Nova), wanted to share something relevant.

Fashion e-commerce is now the #1 target for ADA lawsuits - 5,000+ filed in 2025 alone. And the plaintiff attorneys are getting more sophisticated, specifically targeting brands with high revenue and visibility.

I built tryinclusiv.com to help brands like the ones you've led identify and fix accessibility issues before they become legal exposure.

Happy to run a scan on skims.com and share the findings - no strings attached. Just 15 minutes to walk through what we'd flag.

Worth a quick call?

Colin
```

### GYMSHARK
**Connection Request for Carly Natalizia:**
```
Carly, congrats on the CDO role! As you optimize Gymshark's digital experience, accessibility is becoming a critical compliance area. Happy to share insights from our fashion e-commerce research.
```

**Follow-up InMail:**
```
Thanks for connecting, Carly!

As Gymshark's first CDO, you're uniquely positioned to think holistically about the digital experience. Wanted to share something that might be valuable:

Accessibility compliance is becoming a major focus area for fashion e-commerce:
- 5,000+ ADA lawsuits in 2025 (37% YoY increase)
- Fashion/apparel is the #1 targeted industry
- EU's EAA deadline is also approaching (June 2025)

I built tryinclusiv.com to help brands like Gymshark identify accessibility gaps before they become legal or regulatory exposure.

Happy to run a scan on gymshark.com and walk you through the findings. Takes 15 minutes and might save your team some surprises.

Best,
Colin
