## EMAIL TO YOUR CONTACTS (Personalize the [NAME])

**Subject:** Quick favor - launching today, need your help

```
Hey [NAME],

I'm launching my accessibility SaaS today and going all-in to get my first 50 customers.

Quick pitch: Websites are legally required to be accessible (ADA in US, EAA in Europe). Most aren't. My tool scans for issues and shows how to fix them.

**The ask (pick one):**

1. **If you have a website:** Try the free scanner at tryinclusiv.com - takes 30 seconds. If you see value, I'm doing lifetime access for $199 today only (normally $6K/year).

2. **If you know someone with a website:** Forward this email or share tryinclusiv.com. Every share helps massively.

3. **If you're on social:** A retweet/share of my launch post would be huge. [TWITTER_LINK]

Thanks for any help you can give. Means a lot.

Colin
