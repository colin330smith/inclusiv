## AGENCY PARTNERSHIPS

### Shopify Agencies

```
Subject: Partnership inquiry - accessibility tool for your Shopify clients

Hi [Agency Name] team,

I noticed you're a [Shopify Plus Partner / Shopify Expert]. Quick question:

How are you handling accessibility compliance for clients, especially with the EAA now enforced in Europe?

I built Inclusiv (tryinclusiv.com) - a WCAG scanner that generates Shopify-specific code fixes. Takes 30 seconds to scan, shows exactly what to fix.

**Partnership idea:**
- You get a white-label version or partner discount
- Bundle with your builds/retainers
- New revenue stream for you, compliance for clients

Would a quick call make sense to explore this? Or happy to give you a free account to test first.

Best,
Colin

### WordPress/WooCommerce Agencies

```
Subject: WCAG compliance tool for your WordPress clients

Hi [Agency Name],

With the EAA enforced and ADA lawsuits rising, how are your clients handling accessibility?

I built Inclusiv - a WCAG scanner specifically optimized for WordPress/WooCommerce. It identifies issues AND generates the actual code fixes.

**For agencies:**
- White-label option available
- Partner pricing for client deployments
- Could be a new service line for you

Free scan at tryinclusiv.com - try it on a client site.

Interested in exploring a partnership?

### Digital Marketing Agencies

```
Subject: Add accessibility compliance to your service offerings?

Hi [Agency Name],

Quick thought: accessibility compliance is becoming a must-have for e-commerce clients. EAA enforcement started June 2025, ADA lawsuits hit 5K+ last year.

I built a tool (tryinclusiv.com) that scans sites and generates specific fixes. Takes 30 seconds.

**Partnership opportunity:**
- Add accessibility audits to your packages
- We provide the tech, you provide the service
- New revenue stream with high margins

Worth a conversation?

Subject: Accessibility scanning integration

Hi [Company] team,

I've built Inclusiv, a WCAG accessibility scanner. Currently web-based, but I see an opportunity for CI/CD integration.

I've built Inclusiv - a WCAG scanner that generates platform-specific fixes. Currently supporting Shopify, WordPress, React, etc.

**Integration idea:**
- Native accessibility scanning in [Platform]
- Users see issues + fixes without leaving builder
- Compliance becomes a differentiator for you
