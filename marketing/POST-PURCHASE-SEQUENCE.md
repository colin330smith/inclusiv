## EMAIL 2: DAY 1 (24 hours later)

**Subject:** Did you run your first scan?

```
Hey [Name],

Quick check-in! Have you had a chance to scan your site yet?

If not, here's a direct link: tryinclusiv.com

**What to look for in your report:**

🔴 Critical issues - Fix these first. They block users entirely.
🟠 Serious issues - Important but not blocking.
🟡 Moderate issues - Good to fix when you can.

Most sites score 50-70 on first scan. Anything below 70 is lawsuit territory.

**Common quick wins:**
- Add alt text to images
- Fix color contrast
- Add form labels
- Fix heading hierarchy

Let me know how it goes!

## EMAIL 3: DAY 3

**Subject:** How's the accessibility work going?

```
Hey [Name],

Just checking in on your progress.

A few things that might help:

**1. Prioritize by impact**
Critical issues first. One critical fix is worth ten moderate fixes.

**2. Don't try to fix everything at once**
Pick 5 issues per week. Steady progress beats burnout.

**3. Use the code fixes**
We generate platform-specific fixes. Copy-paste when possible.

**Need a hand?**
Happy to jump on a quick call to walk through your report. Just reply with a time that works.

It's been a week since you joined Inclusiv. How's it going?

Quick favor: Would you mind sharing a brief testimonial about your experience?

Just 1-2 sentences about:
- What you liked
- What results you got
- Would you recommend it

**Examples:**
- "Found 47 issues I didn't know about. The Shopify fixes were copy-paste ready."
- "Went from score 52 to 84 in two weeks using the recommendations."
- "Finally understand what accessibility issues my site has."

Just reply to this email with your thoughts. Would mean a lot as we grow.

Thanks!
Colin

P.S. - Happy to feature you on our site with a link back to yours if you're interested.
