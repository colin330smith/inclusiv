## REDDIT POST (r/SideProject) - COPY PASTE READY

**Title:** I built a free WCAG accessibility scanner - would love feedback

**Body:**
Hey everyone,

I've been working on this for the past few months. It's a free tool that scans websites for accessibility issues against WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

The EAA (European Accessibility Act) deadline passed in June 2025, and I noticed a lot of businesses don't know if they're compliant. ADA lawsuits in the US hit 4,000+ last year.

**What it does:**
- Scans any URL in ~30 seconds
- Shows your accessibility score (0-100)
- Lists specific issues to fix
- Detects your platform (WordPress, Shopify, React, etc.)
- Generates AI code fixes for your specific platform

**Tech stack:** Next.js, axe-core, Playwright

I scanned some major brands this week:
- Chubbies Shorts: 0/100 (102 issues)
- HiSmile: 0/100 (134 issues)
- Alo Yoga: 48/100 (21 issues)

Most sites don't even know they have these problems.

Would love any feedback on the UX or features you'd want to see.

## LINKEDIN POST - COPY PASTE READY

I scanned 50 major e-commerce websites for accessibility compliance.

78% would fail an accessibility audit.

The worst scores:
- Chubbies Shorts: 0/100 (102 critical issues)
- HiSmile: 0/100 (134 critical issues)
- Nike: 54/100 (16 critical issues)

With ADA lawsuits at 4,000+/year and the European Accessibility Act now enforceable (fines up to €100,000)... this is real legal exposure.

I built a free scanner to help: tryinclusiv.com

30 seconds. No signup. Shows exactly what's broken.
