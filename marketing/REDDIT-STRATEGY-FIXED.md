# Reddit Strategy - Lessons Learned & Fixed Approach

## Why the Post Was Removed

1. **Self-promotion in r/webdev** - This subreddit has strict 10:1 rules
2. **Marketing language detected** - "Check your score now" is obvious CTA
3. **No community reputation** - First post can't be promotional
4. **Framed as "study" but was clearly promotion** - Mods see through this

## The New Approach: Authentic Value-First

### Better Subreddits for Our Content

| Subreddit | Allows Self-Promo | Approach |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| r/SideProject | YES | "I built a free accessibility scanner" |
| r/startups | YES | Startup journey + tool |
| r/IMadeThis | YES | Showcase the build |
| r/accessibility | Relevant | Ask for feedback from the community |
| r/Entrepreneur | Moderate | Share learnings, not product |
| r/webdev | NO direct promo | Comment helpfully first for 2 weeks |

### Post Templates That Won't Get Removed

**r/SideProject Format:**
```
Title: I built a free WCAG accessibility scanner - would love feedback

Body:
Hey everyone,

I've been working on this for the past few months. It's a free tool that scans websites for accessibility issues against WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

The EAA (European Accessibility Act) deadline passed in June 2025, and I noticed a lot of businesses don't know if they're compliant.

**What it does:**
- Scans any URL in ~30 seconds
- Shows your accessibility score
- Lists specific issues to fix
- Detects your platform (WordPress, Shopify, etc.)

**Tech stack:** Next.js, axe-core, Playwright

Would love any feedback on the UX or features you'd want to see.

**r/accessibility Format:**
```
Title: Free tool to check WCAG 2.1 AA compliance - feedback wanted

Body:
I built a scanner that checks websites against WCAG 2.1 AA criteria. It's completely free and doesn't require signup.

My goal is to make accessibility testing more approachable for businesses that aren't familiar with WCAG.

I'd really value feedback from this community:
- Is the scoring methodology reasonable?
- What issues am I missing?
- How can I make the results more actionable?

### Rules to Follow

1. **No marketing language** - Remove all CTAs
2. **Ask for feedback** - Makes it about community, not you
3. **Be transparent** - "I built this" not "we found"
4. **Engage in comments** - Reply thoughtfully to everyone
5. **Share the journey** - People love builder stories
6. **Link at the end, casually** - Not the focus of the post
7. **Don't fake data** - If you haven't scanned 500 sites, don't say you did

### Timing

- Post during peak hours: 9-11am EST weekdays
- r/SideProject: Sunday is popular
- Engage with other posts before posting yours
- Reply to comments within 1 hour

### Recovery Strategy

1. **Week 1**: Comment helpfully on 10+ posts per day in target subreddits
2. **Week 2**: Continue engaging, share tool in r/SideProject (most forgiving)
3. **Week 3**: If r/SideProject goes well, try r/accessibility
4. **Never**: Post promotional content to r/webdev without established history

## What Not To Do (Learned the Hard Way)

- Don't pretend research/study when it's promotion
- Don't use marketing language ("Check your score now")
- Don't post and disappear - engagement is required
- Don't cross-post the same content everywhere
- Don't include CTAs in the main post
- Don't exaggerate numbers or fake data
