## r/webdev VARIATIONS

### Version A (Technical Focus)
```
Title: I built a WCAG 2.1 scanner using axe-core + Puppeteer - free to use, lifetime deals for first 50

Built this over 5 months because I kept seeing sites fail basic accessibility checks. The European Accessibility Act is now enforced (€100K fines), and I figured there's a market.

Stack: Next.js, Puppeteer, axe-core, Vercel

Free scanner: tryinclusiv.com

Today I'm doing lifetime deals for $199 (normally $6K/year) to get my first 50 users. Need feedback + case studies.

Happy to discuss the technical implementation or WCAG compliance.
```

### Version B (Problem Focus)
```
Title: 78% of EU e-commerce sites fail accessibility audits - I built a free scanner

I scanned 500+ sites last month. Average score: 62/100. Most don't even know they have issues.

Built a free WCAG scanner at tryinclusiv.com - takes 30 seconds, no signup.

Doing lifetime deals for $199 today for first 50 people (normally $499/mo). Need real users for feedback.

What's the accessibility situation like at your company?
```

### Version C (Value Focus)
```
Title: Free WCAG accessibility scanner - saved a client from a $50K lawsuit last month

Quick backstory: Agency client got a demand letter. Ran their site through my scanner, found 47 issues, fixed them, lawyer went away.

Built it into a product: tryinclusiv.com

Free to scan. $199 lifetime if you want monitoring (normally $6K/year). First 50 customers only.

AMA about accessibility compliance or the tech stack.
```

## r/entrepreneur VARIATIONS

### Version A (Building in Public)
```
Title: Day 14 at $0 MRR - launching lifetime deals today, roast my strategy

Built an accessibility SaaS. Product works. Marketing... not so much.

Current stats:
- MRR: $0
- Product: WCAG scanner (tryinclusiv.com)
- Problem: EAA enforcement started, businesses need compliance

Today's play: $199 lifetime (normally $6K/year) for first 50 customers.

Is this stupid? Should I be doing something else? Genuine feedback appreciated.
```

### Version B (Results Focus)
```
Title: How I'm trying to get my first 50 customers in one day (with $0 ad spend)

Building in public. Accessibility SaaS at $0 MRR.

The plan:
1. Scan sites of potential customers
2. Cold outreach with their specific issues
3. Lifetime deal: $199 (normally $499/mo)
4. Target: 50 customers = $10K

Free scanner: tryinclusiv.com

Will report back tonight with results. Any suggestions?
```

### Version C (Fear/Urgency)
```
Title: $5M lawsuit settlements, 5000+ cases/year - why I built an accessibility tool

Fashion Nova paid $5M. Domino's went to the Supreme Court. Lawsuits up 37% in 2025.

I built tryinclusiv.com - scans your site for WCAG issues in 30 seconds.

Launching with $199 lifetime deals today (normally $6K/year). First 50 only.

Is fear-based marketing for legal compliance scummy? Genuinely asking.
```

## r/startups VARIATIONS

### Version A (Honest Struggle)
```
Title: 5 months, $15K spent, $0 revenue - trying something drastic today

Built an accessibility scanner. Good problem (EAA enforcement, ADA lawsuits), working product, zero customers.

Today: $199 lifetime deal for first 50 people. All-in on distribution.

tryinclusiv.com

Tell me what I'm doing wrong. Seriously.
```

### Version B (Strategy Discussion)
```
Title: Lifetime deals to acquire first customers - smart or desperate?

Context: B2B SaaS, $0 MRR, accessibility compliance space

Plan: Offer $199 lifetime (normally $499/mo) to first 50 customers

Reasoning:
- Need users for feedback
- Need case studies for social proof
- Cash now > recurring later (at this stage)

tryinclusiv.com

Is this the right call? What would you do differently?
```

## r/SaaS VARIATIONS

### Version A (Metrics Focus)
```
Title: Launch day metrics thread - going from $0 to (hopefully) $10K in 24 hours

Starting stats:
- MRR: $0
- Customers: 0
- Email list: 0
- Product: WCAG accessibility scanner

The play:
- $199 lifetime deals (50 spots)
- Cold outreach to sites with bad scores
- Reddit/HN/Twitter blitz

tryinclusiv.com

Will update hourly with metrics. Roast my approach.
```

### Version B (Niche Focus)
```
Title: Accessibility compliance SaaS - is this market real?

European Accessibility Act enforcement started June 2025. ADA lawsuits hit 5K/year.

Built tryinclusiv.com - WCAG scanner with fix recommendations.

Launching lifetime deals today: $199 (normally $499/mo)

Questions:
1. Is compliance fear enough to drive purchases?
2. Should I target agencies or direct?
3. Pricing too low/high for lifetime?
```
