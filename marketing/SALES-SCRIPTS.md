## INBOUND INQUIRY RESPONSE

### When someone asks "Tell me more"

```
Thanks for reaching out!

Quick rundown:

1. **What it does:** Scans your site for WCAG 2.1 accessibility issues - the same standard required by the ADA in the US and the EAA in Europe.

2. **What you get:**
   - Instant accessibility score (0-100)
   - List of all issues with severity ratings
   - Specific code fixes for your platform
   - Continuous monitoring (paid plans)

3. **Why now:** The European Accessibility Act started enforcement June 2025. 5,000+ ADA lawsuits were filed last year. Companies like Fashion Nova paid $5M+ to settle.

4. **The offer:** $199 one-time for lifetime access (normally $499/month). First 50 customers only.

Want me to run a quick scan on your site? Takes 30 seconds and I can walk you through the results.

### When someone asks about pricing

```
Great question. Here's the breakdown:

**Today only - Founding Member Deal:**
$199 one-time = Lifetime access

**What's included:**
- Unlimited site scans
- Full issue reports with code fixes
- Continuous monitoring
- Priority support forever

**Why so cheap?**
I'm at $0 MRR and need my first 50 customers for feedback and case studies. You get locked-in lifetime access, I get real users. Win-win.

**Normal pricing (after 50 spots):**
$499/month

### When someone says "Let me think about it"

```
Totally understand - it's a business decision.

A few things to consider:

1. **The math:** One ADA demand letter costs $5K-$15K to settle. Lawsuits average $25K-$100K. Our tool is $199 once.

2. **The risk:** Plaintiffs' attorneys use automated scanners to find targets. If you have issues, they will find them eventually.

3. **The offer:** This $199 lifetime deal is only for my first 50 customers. After that, it's $499/month.

No pressure though. If you want to think about it, I'd suggest at least running the free scan so you know where you stand: tryinclusiv.com

Any specific concerns I can address?
```

### When someone says "Too expensive"

```
I hear you. Let me give you some context:

**The $199 covers:**
- Unlimited scans (forever)
- Full reports with code fixes
- Continuous monitoring
- Priority support

**Compare to:**
- Manual WCAG audit: $5,000-$50,000
- Accessibility consultant: $150-300/hour
- ADA lawsuit settlement: $25,000-$100,000
- Fashion Nova settlement: $5,000,000+

**Our tool pays for itself if it prevents ONE demand letter.**

That said, I get it's still money. Would it help if I ran a free scan first so you can see exactly what issues you have and decide if it's worth fixing?
```

### When someone says "We already have a developer"

```
Perfect - that actually makes this more valuable.

Here's why:

1. **Time savings:** Our tool generates platform-specific code fixes. Instead of your dev researching WCAG guidelines for hours, they get copy-paste solutions.

2. **Monitoring:** Developers ship code. New issues appear. Our continuous monitoring catches them before they become legal problems.

3. **Proof:** If you ever get a demand letter, you have documented proof you're actively working on compliance. That's valuable in negotiations.

Your dev can focus on features. We handle the compliance scanning. $199 one-time is probably less than 2 hours of their time.

### When someone mentions a competitor (accessiBe, AudioEye, etc.)

```
Good that you're taking accessibility seriously!

Quick thoughts on overlays vs. what we do:

**Overlays (accessiBe, AudioEye, etc.):**
- Add JavaScript widget to your site
- Don't actually fix underlying code
- Some lawsuit cases specifically mention overlay users
- Mixed reputation in accessibility community

**What we do:**
- Scan and identify actual code issues
- Generate fixes for YOUR specific platform
- You implement real fixes = real compliance
- No dependency on third-party widget

Different approaches. Ours is "fix the code" vs "add a band-aid."

Have you had good results with your current solution? What's your compliance score?
