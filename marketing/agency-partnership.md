## 2. Partnership Pitch Emails

### Email Variant A: The Urgency Play

**Subject Lines (A/B test):**
- "Your e-commerce clients need this by June 28th"
- "EAA compliance: new revenue stream for [Agency Name]"
- "Quick question about accessibility services"

```
Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Agency Name] builds e-commerce sites for brands across Europe. Quick question: how are you handling the European Accessibility Act deadline for your clients?

Since June 2025, every e-commerce site selling to EU customers must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards or face potential fines and store shutdowns. Most agencies are scrambling to add accessibility services—and that's exactly why I'm reaching out.

We built Inclusiv specifically for this moment.

**For your agency:**
- White-label our scanner under your brand
- Scan unlimited client sites
- Generate professional compliance reports
- 20% revenue share on referrals (or wholesale pricing)

**For your clients:**
- Instant WCAG 2.1 AA compliance scanning
- Prioritized fix recommendations
- Ongoing monitoring for new issues
- Documentation for regulatory proof

We're partnering with 50 EU agencies this quarter. I'd love to show you a 10-minute demo and discuss how this fits your services.

Worth a quick call this week?

Best,
[Your Name]
Inclusiv | EAA Compliance Made Simple
```

---

### Email Variant B: The Revenue Opportunity

**Subject Lines (A/B test):**
- "Add €50K+ ARR with zero development"
- "New service line for [Agency Name] (no coding required)"
- "Partnership opportunity: accessibility scanning"

```
Hi [First Name],

What if [Agency Name] could add accessibility compliance as a service—without building anything?

The European Accessibility Act just created a €2B+ compliance market overnight. Every e-commerce site serving EU customers now needs:
✓ WCAG 2.1 AA compliance scanning
✓ Accessibility monitoring
✓ Remediation guidance
✓ Regulatory documentation

Most agencies can't build this in-house. That's where our partnership comes in.

**Here's the math for your agency:**

If you have 50 e-commerce clients:
- €199/month per client = €9,950/month
- Your 20% revenue share = €1,990/month
- Annual recurring revenue = €23,880

Or choose wholesale pricing at 40% off and resell at your margin.

We handle the technology. You handle the relationships. Your clients get compliant.

I've attached a one-pager on our partner program. Can we schedule 15 minutes to see if there's a fit?

Best,
[Your Name]
Inclusiv | EAA Compliance for E-commerce
```

---

### Email Variant C: The Problem-Solution Approach

**Subject Lines (A/B test):**
- "Solving your clients' EAA problem"
- "The accessibility question your clients are asking"
- "[Agency Name] + Inclusiv: compliance partnership"

```
Hi [First Name],

I'll keep this brief.

Your e-commerce clients are probably asking you about the European Accessibility Act. If they're not yet, they will be soon—because non-compliance means potential store shutdowns and fines.

The problem: Building accessibility expertise takes years. Hiring specialists is expensive. Manual audits don't scale.

The solution: Partner with Inclusiv.

We provide:
→ Automated WCAG 2.1 AA scanning for e-commerce
→ White-label reports with your branding
→ Developer-friendly fix recommendations
→ Ongoing compliance monitoring

You provide:
→ Client relationships
→ Implementation support (if desired)
→ The trusted advisor role

Our top partners are adding €30K+ in annual recurring revenue without writing a line of code.

I'd love to show you how this works in practice. Free to chat this week?

Best,
[Your Name]
Inclusiv
```

### Follow-Up Sequence

**Follow-up #1 (Day 3):**
```
Subject: Re: [Original subject]

Hi [First Name],

Just floating this back up. I know agency life is busy.

Quick stat: 78% of EU e-commerce sites currently fail basic accessibility standards. That's a lot of potential remediation work for your team.

Let me know if a 10-minute call makes sense.

[Your Name]
```

**Follow-up #2 (Day 7):**
```
Subject: One more thing

Hi [First Name],

Last note from me. I wanted to share that we just partnered with [Similar Agency Name] to handle accessibility for their 40+ e-commerce clients.

If timing isn't right now, no worries at all. But if accessibility services are on your 2026 roadmap, I'd love to be a resource.

Either way, wishing [Agency Name] a great quarter.

[Your Name]
```

### Email 3: First Client Guide (Day 3)

**Subject:** How to Land Your First Inclusiv Client (Step-by-Step)

```
Hi [Partner Name],

Ready to close your first accessibility deal? Here's the proven playbook our top partners use.

**Step 1: Identify Your Best Prospects**

Look for clients who:
✓ Sell to EU customers (mandatory EAA compliance)
✓ Have 10+ employees or €2M+ revenue (EAA threshold)
✓ Recently redesigned their site (accessibility often missed)
✓ Are in regulated industries (extra compliance pressure)
✓ Have asked about accessibility before

**Step 2: The Opening Conversation**

Don't lead with "accessibility." Lead with compliance risk:

"Hey [Client], quick question—has anyone talked to you about the European Accessibility Act? It went into effect in June and applies to your online store. I wanted to make sure you're aware of the requirements."

**Step 3: The Free Scan Offer**

"We've partnered with an accessibility scanning tool. Would you like us to run a free scan on your site? It takes 5 minutes and will show exactly where you stand."

Run the scan. Share the report. The issues speak for themselves.

**Step 4: The Proposal**

Position ongoing monitoring, not just a one-time fix:

"Based on this scan, here's what needs attention. We recommend:
1. Initial remediation (one-time project)
2. Ongoing monitoring to catch new issues (monthly service)

This keeps you compliant as your site evolves."

**Step 5: Close and Onboard**

[Referral partners] Make the intro to Inclusiv. We handle from here.
[Reseller partners] Set up their account in your dashboard.
[White-label partners] Onboard them to your branded platform.

**Templates to use:**

- Initial outreach email [Link]
- Free scan offer script [Link]
- Proposal template [Link]
- Pricing presentation [Link]

**Your first client bonus:**

Close your first deal within 30 days and we'll add an extra month of commission (referral) or 5 bonus licenses (reseller).

Go get 'em,
[Partner Manager Name]

### Slide 6: The Math

**Partner Revenue Calculator**

*Example: 25 e-commerce clients*

**Referral Partner (20% share):**
- 25 clients × €199/mo × 20% = €995/month
- Annual: €11,940

**Reseller Partner (40% margin):**
- 25 clients × €80/mo margin = €2,000/month
- Annual: €24,000

**White-Label Partner (60% margin):**
- 25 clients × €119/mo margin = €2,975/month
- Annual: €35,700

*Zero development cost. Launch in weeks, not months.*
