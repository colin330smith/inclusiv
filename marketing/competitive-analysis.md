# Inclusiv Competitive Intelligence Report
## Strategic Competitive Analysis & Market Positioning

*Last Updated: January 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

The web accessibility market is experiencing explosive growth driven by:
- **European Accessibility Act (EAA)** enforcement beginning June 28, 2025
- **ADA lawsuits** projected at 5,000+ in 2025 (20% increase YoY)
- **101 million EU citizens** (1 in 4 over age 16) affected by accessibility barriers
- **FTC crackdown** on overlay providers ($1M fine against accessiBe in April 2025)

**Inclusiv's opportunity**: Position as the **EAA-first, code-level solution** that actually fixes accessibility issues rather than masking them with overlays.

## Part 2: Competitive Positioning - Inclusiv's Unique Position

### The Market Gap Inclusiv Fills

| Market Need | Current Solutions | Inclusiv Advantage |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **EAA Compliance** | Generic WCAG tools | **EAA-specific scanning & guidance** |
| **Code Fixes** | Problem lists only | **AI-generated code fixes** |
| **E-commerce Focus** | General websites | **Shopify/WooCommerce specialists** |
| **Instant Results** | Consulting cycles | **Scan in seconds** |
| **Affordable** | $30K+ enterprise | **SMB-friendly pricing** |
| **Legitimate Solution** | Overlays that get sued | **Real remediation** |

### Inclusiv's Four Pillars of Differentiation

#### 1. EAA-Specific Focus (vs Generic Accessibility)

**The Problem**: Most tools focus on ADA/WCAG generically. The EAA has specific requirements:
- EN 301 549 technical standard
- Mandatory accessibility statements
- E-commerce service requirements
- June 2025 enforcement deadline

**Inclusiv's Advantage**:
- Built specifically for EAA compliance
- EN 301 549 mapping
- Accessibility statement generator
- E-commerce specific checks
- EU market focus

**Messaging**: *"The only accessibility platform built specifically for European Accessibility Act compliance."*

#### 2. Instant Scanning (vs Consulting/Overlays)

**The Problem**:
- Consulting: Weeks/months for audits, $10K-$100K costs
- Overlays: Instant but don't actually work (lawsuits prove this)

**Inclusiv's Advantage**:
- Scan results in seconds
- No waiting for consultants
- No fake overlay "fixes"
- Real issues identified immediately
- Continuous monitoring

**Messaging**: *"Know your EAA compliance status in 60 seconds, not 60 days."*

#### 3. AI-Powered Code Fixes (vs Just Problem Lists)

**The Problem**: Every tool tells you what's wrong. None tell you how to fix it.
- WAVE: "Missing alt text" - okay, now what?
- Lighthouse: Score of 72 - but what code changes?
- Siteimprove: 847 issues found - developer overwhelmed

**Inclusiv's Advantage**:
- Identifies the problem
- Shows the exact code location
- **Generates the fix code**
- Copy-paste remediation
- AI-powered fix suggestions

**Messaging**: *"Don't just find problems. Fix them. AI-generated code fixes you can implement in minutes."*

#### 4. E-Commerce Focus (vs General Websites)

**The Problem**: E-commerce has unique accessibility challenges:
- Product image alt text at scale
- Checkout flow accessibility
- Cart and filter interactions
- Price and availability announcements
- Form validation for purchases

**Inclusiv's Advantage**:
- Shopify app integration
- WooCommerce plugin
- E-commerce specific rules
- Product-focused scanning
- Checkout flow analysis

**Messaging**: *"Built for online stores. Because your checkout matters more than your blog."*

## Part 3: Sales Battle Cards

### Battle Card: accessiBe

**When prospect mentions accessiBe, respond:**

> "accessiBe is an overlay solution - a JavaScript widget that sits on top of your code. Here's what you should know:
>
> 1. **FTC fined them $1 million** in April 2025 for misrepresenting their AI capabilities
> 2. **25% of 2024 ADA lawsuits** targeted sites using overlays like accessiBe
> 3. **Class action lawsuit** filed against them in June 2024
> 4. The **National Federation of the Blind** explicitly opposes overlay solutions
>
> Overlays don't fix your code - they mask problems. When a screen reader user visits your site, the underlying issues remain.
>
> Inclusiv is different: we scan your code, identify the actual problems, and give you AI-generated fixes you can implement. Real compliance, not a widget that could get you sued."

**Key Stats to Quote**:
- 1,023 lawsuits in 2024 against overlay users
- $1M FTC fine
- 700+ accessibility professionals signed against overlays
- Overlays detect only 20-30% of issues

---

### Battle Card: UserWay

**When prospect mentions UserWay, respond:**

> "UserWay is facing similar challenges to accessiBe. They're currently being sued in a class action lawsuit filed in February 2025.
>
> A company called BloomsyBox installed UserWay, and just 6 months later they were hit with an ADA lawsuit. The overlay didn't protect them - it may have made them a target.
>
> The fundamental problem: UserWay is an overlay. It doesn't provide true keyboard navigation. It doesn't add proper ARIA attributes. It doesn't fix your actual code.
>
> With Inclusiv, you get real fixes at the code level. We identify issues and generate the actual code changes needed. That's compliance you can trust."

**Key Stats to Quote**:
- Class action lawsuit (BloomsyBox v. UserWay)
- Customer sued 6 months after installing
- Courts have rejected overlays as compliance evidence
- Missing true keyboard nav and ARIA support

---

### Battle Card: AudioEye

**When prospect mentions AudioEye, respond:**

> "AudioEye is better than pure overlays, but there are important considerations:
>
> 1. Their **entry tier only addresses ~50%** of accessibility issues - they admit this themselves
> 2. Full remediation requires their expensive enterprise tier
> 3. Pricing isn't transparent - you'll need multiple sales calls
> 4. They still use overlay technology as their foundation
>
> For EAA compliance specifically, Inclusiv offers:
> - Complete scanning in seconds (not sales cycles)
> - AI-generated code fixes (not just reports)
> - Transparent pricing (no enterprise upsell)
> - EAA-specific compliance (not generic WCAG)
>
> If you're targeting the EU market, we're built specifically for that regulation."

**Key Differentiator**: EAA focus + transparent pricing + code fixes vs. hybrid overlay approach

---

### Battle Card: Siteimprove

**When prospect mentions Siteimprove, respond:**

> "Siteimprove is a solid enterprise platform - but it's built for large organizations with $30-50K+ annual budgets.
>
> Key considerations:
> 1. **Average customer pays $28,000/year** - overkill for most e-commerce businesses
> 2. **Accessibility is just one module** - you're paying for governance features you may not need
> 3. **No code fixes** - just reports of problems
> 4. **Not EAA-specialist** - it's a general platform
>
> Inclusiv gives you what Siteimprove's accessibility module does at a fraction of the cost, plus:
> - AI-generated code fixes
> - E-commerce specific scanning
> - EAA compliance focus
> - Transparent, affordable pricing"

**Key Differentiator**: 10x more affordable + code fixes + EAA focus

---

### Battle Card: WAVE/Lighthouse

**When prospect mentions WAVE or Lighthouse, respond:**

> "WAVE and Lighthouse are great free tools - we actually recommend using them! But they have important limitations:
>
> 1. **Testing only** - they identify problems but don't help fix them
> 2. **Single page** - no site-wide scanning or monitoring
> 3. **~30% coverage** - Lighthouse only tests about 30% of WCAG criteria
> 4. **No EAA specifics** - generic WCAG testing
> 5. **Manual interpretation** - you need expertise to understand results
>
> Think of WAVE/Lighthouse as a flashlight. Inclusiv is the flashlight PLUS the toolbox PLUS the instructions.
>
> We identify issues across your entire site, prioritize them for EAA compliance, and generate the code to fix them. That's the difference between a free tool and a compliance platform."

**Key Differentiator**: From testing to fixing - complete solution

---

### Battle Card: Deque/axe

**When prospect mentions Deque or axe, respond:**

> "Deque's axe engine is excellent - it's actually the industry standard for accessibility testing. Many tools (including aspects of ours) leverage axe-core.
>
> But Deque is built for enterprise development teams:
> 1. **Developer-focused** - requires technical expertise
> 2. **No public pricing** - enterprise sales process
> 3. **Testing only** - no automated code fixes
> 4. **Not EAA-specialist** - generic WCAG focus
>
> If you have a dedicated accessibility team and DevOps pipeline, Deque is great. If you're an e-commerce business needing EAA compliance with actionable fixes, Inclusiv is built for you.
>
> We give you the power of professional accessibility testing with AI-generated fixes any team can implement."

**Key Differentiator**: Business user friendly + code fixes + EAA focus

---

### Battle Card: Level Access

**When prospect mentions Level Access, respond:**

> "Level Access is the Rolls Royce of accessibility - Fortune 500 companies and government agencies use them.
>
> But consider:
> 1. **Starting at $30-50K+/year** - significant investment
> 2. **Adding sites costs exponentially more** - not linear scaling
> 3. **Long sales and implementation cycles** - weeks to months
> 4. **Built for complex enterprises** - overkill for focused needs
>
> If you're a large enterprise with a dedicated accessibility program, Level Access makes sense. If you're an e-commerce business needing EAA compliance now, Inclusiv delivers:
> - Immediate scanning (minutes, not months)
> - Affordable pricing (transparent, no surprises)
> - AI code fixes (not just consulting reports)
> - E-commerce specialization"

**Key Differentiator**: Speed + affordability + self-service capability

---

### Battle Card: EqualWeb

**When prospect mentions EqualWeb, respond:**

> "EqualWeb is another overlay provider from Israel, similar to accessiBe and UserWay.
>
> They market a '$1 million warranty' - but read the fine print carefully. The overlay lawsuits hitting accessiBe and UserWay customers show that warranties don't prevent lawsuits.
>
> The fundamental issue remains: overlays don't fix code. They're a bandaid that courts and regulators don't accept as compliance.
>
> Inclusiv provides real remediation:
> - We identify actual code issues
> - We generate fixes you implement
> - Your site becomes genuinely accessible
> - That's real compliance, not a warranty gamble."

**Key Differentiator**: Real fixes vs. warranty theater

## Part 6: Anti-Overlay Content Strategy

### Content Piece 1: "Why Accessibility Overlays Don't Work (And Why They Might Get You Sued)"

**Headline Options**:
- "The $1 Million FTC Fine That Should Make You Rethink Overlays"
- "25% of ADA Lawsuits Target Overlay Users: Here's Why"
- "Accessibility Overlays: The 'Solution' That Creates More Problems"

**Key Points to Cover**:

1. **The Data Is Clear: Overlays Attract Lawsuits**
   - 1,023 lawsuits in 2024 against overlay users (25% of total)
   - 456 lawsuits in H1 2025 (22.6% of filings)
   - Over 300 new suits in first half of 2025 alone
   - Courts ordering removal of overlays in settlements

2. **The FTC Has Spoken**
   - $1 million fine against accessiBe (April 2025)
   - Federal finding: misrepresented AI capabilities
   - Violated federal law with compliance claims
   - Sets precedent for entire overlay industry

3. **Why Overlays Fail Technically**
   - Only detect 20-30% of accessibility issues
   - Cannot add proper ARIA attributes
   - Cannot provide true keyboard navigation
   - Cannot fix underlying HTML structure
   - Screen readers interact with code, not overlays

4. **The Disability Community Has Spoken**
   - National Federation of the Blind opposes overlays
   - 700+ accessibility professionals signed Overlay Fact Sheet
   - Users with disabilities report overlays make sites WORSE
   - "Misleading, unproven, and unethical claims"

5. **The Legal Trap**
   - Installing an overlay signals you KNOW you have accessibility issues
   - Plaintiffs argue: "They knew and chose a cheap fix over real remediation"
   - Creates paper trail of awareness without compliance
   - No court has accepted overlay as compliance defense

**CTA**: "Get real compliance with code-level fixes. Scan your site with Inclusiv."

### Content Piece 2: "Overlay vs. Real Remediation: A Side-by-Side Comparison"

| Factor | Overlays (accessiBe, UserWay) | Real Remediation (Inclusiv) |
|--------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **How It Works** | JavaScript widget sits on top of your code | Scans code, identifies issues, generates fixes |
| **What Gets Fixed** | Nothing - issues are masked | Actual HTML/CSS/ARIA code |
| **Screen Reader Experience** | Still encounters underlying problems | Genuinely accessible content |
| **Lawsuit Protection** | 25% of lawsuits target overlay users | Real compliance = real protection |
| **FTC Status** | $1M fine for misleading claims | No enforcement issues |
| **Disability Community View** | Explicitly opposed | Supported approach |
| **EAA Compliance** | Not recognized | Addresses actual requirements |
| **Time to "Compliance"** | Minutes (false) | Hours to days (real) |
| **Total Cost of Ownership** | Widget + potential lawsuit | Platform subscription |

### Content Piece 3: "The True Cost of Accessibility Overlays"

**Financial Analysis**:

| Cost Factor | Overlay Approach | Real Remediation |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| Annual Subscription | $500-$4,000 | $1,000-$5,000 |
| ADA Demand Letter Response | $5,000-$15,000 | $0 (prevented) |
| Settlement if Sued | $10,000-$100,000+ | $0 (prevented) |
| Remediation After Lawsuit | $10,000-$50,000 | Already done |
| Reputation Damage | Incalculable | N/A |
| **5-Year TCO (if sued once)** | **$75,000-$170,000** | **$5,000-$25,000** |

**The Math**:
- 25% of lawsuits target overlay users
- Average ADA settlement: $25,000-$50,000
- Overlay users are MORE likely to be targeted
- "Saving" $500/year could cost $100,000

### Content Piece 4: FAQ - "But What About..."

**Q: "accessiBe/UserWay is so much cheaper and easier"**

A: It's cheaper upfront, but 25% of ADA lawsuits in 2024 targeted sites using these overlays. The FTC fined accessiBe $1 million for misleading claims. The "savings" disappear with one demand letter.

**Q: "They guarantee ADA compliance"**

A: Read the fine print. These guarantees have not held up in court. accessiBe customers have been sued successfully. The FTC determined their compliance claims were false.

**Q: "But I'll have something in place while I work on real fixes"**

A: Installing an overlay creates legal documentation that you knew about accessibility issues. Plaintiffs use this against you: "They acknowledged the problem and chose the cheapest fake solution." Better to scan with a real tool and prioritize actual fixes.

**Q: "My developer said overlays are fine"**

A: Ask your developer about the 700+ accessibility professionals who signed the Overlay Fact Sheet, the National Federation of the Blind's opposition, or the $1M FTC fine. Technical experts in accessibility universally oppose overlays.

**Q: "I just need something for EAA compliance"**

A: The EAA requires that services "be accessible by design." An overlay is not accessibility by design - it's a JavaScript bandaid. EN 301 549 compliance requires actual code changes. Overlays don't satisfy EAA requirements.
