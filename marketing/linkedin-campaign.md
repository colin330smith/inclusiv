Hi [First Name],

Colin
```

Colin
```

## 3. FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE SEQUENCE

### Message 1: Connection Acceptance (Send within 24 hours)
```
Thanks for connecting, [First Name]!

As promised - I ran a quick accessibility scan on [Company website]. Found some interesting patterns I think you'd want to know about.

Three things stood out:
- [Specific issue 1 - e.g., "27 images missing alt text on your homepage"]
- [Specific issue 2 - e.g., "Color contrast issues on your checkout flow"]
- [Specific issue 3 - e.g., "Form labels not properly associated"]

These are exactly the items EAA auditors will flag. Happy to explain what each means if helpful.

Best,
Colin
```

### Message 2: Day 3 - Deep Dive on One Issue
```
Hi [First Name],

Following up on that scan - wanted to highlight something specific.

Your [specific page/feature] has [detailed accessibility issue]. This matters because:

1. It affects [X%] of users (screen reader users, keyboard-only users, etc.)
2. It's a WCAG 2.1 AA violation - mandatory under EAA
3. The fix is actually straightforward: [brief solution]

We've seen this exact issue across 40% of EU e-commerce sites we've analyzed. You're not alone, but getting ahead of it now saves headaches later.

Want me to send over the full findings?

Colin
```

### Message 3: Day 7 - Detailed Report Offer
```
[First Name],

Last message on this - I put together a detailed accessibility report for [Company].

It covers:
- 47 specific issues we detected
- Priority ranking by compliance risk
- Estimated fix time for each item
- Which ones are quick wins vs. need dev resources

No strings attached - just thought it would be useful as you plan for June 2025.

Want me to send it over? Also happy to jump on a 15-min call to walk through the findings if that's easier.

Colin
```

### Message 4: Day 14 - Soft Close (Only if no response)
```
Hi [First Name],

Totally understand if accessibility compliance isn't top priority right now - lots going on.

I'll leave this here: if [Company] needs help before the June deadline, we're offering a fixed-price compliance package that's been popular with [similar company type].

Either way, happy to be a resource. Feel free to reach out anytime.

Colin
```

## 4. LINKEDIN POSTS (5 Posts)

### Post 1: The 500 Site Research Study
```
I just finished analyzing 500 EU e-commerce websites for accessibility compliance.

The results are concerning.

Here's what I found:

94% have critical accessibility issues
Average of 47 WCAG violations per homepage
Only 3% would pass an EAA audit today
Most common issues:
- Missing alt text (89% of sites)
- Keyboard navigation broken (76%)
- Color contrast failures (71%)
- Form labels missing (68%)

The EU Accessibility Act deadline is June 28, 2025.

That's 6 months away.

Fines can reach €100,000+ per violation.

But here's the thing - 80% of these issues can be fixed in under 2 weeks with the right approach.

If you're running an EU e-commerce operation and haven't audited yet, now's the time.

I'm offering free 5-minute accessibility scans for anyone who wants to know where they stand.

Drop a comment or DM me your site URL.

```

### Post 2: Common Accessibility Issues (Educational)
```
"Our website looks fine, accessibility isn't a problem."

I hear this weekly from e-commerce leaders.

Then I show them this:

Your "Add to Cart" button?
A screen reader user can't click it.

Your product images?
A blind shopper has no idea what they show.

Your checkout form?
Someone using only a keyboard gets stuck on step 2.

Your color scheme?
8% of men can't distinguish your error messages.

Accessibility isn't about "disabled users."

It's about:
- The person shopping on their phone in bright sunlight
- The elderly customer who needs larger text
- The user with a broken arm using one hand
- The shopper in a loud environment using captions

That's 15-20% of your potential customers.

Under the EU Accessibility Act, it's also the law.

June 2025 is coming.

The good news? Most fixes are simpler than you think.

What accessibility challenges is your team facing?

```

### Post 3: EAA Penalties (Urgency)
```
Let's talk about what happens after June 28, 2025.

The EU Accessibility Act becomes enforceable.

For e-commerce sites, that means:

FINES:
- Up to €100,000 per violation in Germany
- Up to €75,000 per violation in France
- Similar penalties across all 27 EU member states
- Fines can be DAILY until issues are resolved

ENFORCEMENT:
- Consumer complaints trigger investigations
- Competitor complaints are valid
- Market surveillance authorities conduct random audits
- Class action lawsuits become possible

BUSINESS IMPACT:
- Public naming and shaming
- Mandatory remediation timelines
- Potential sales suspension in severe cases
- Reputation damage

I'm not sharing this to create fear.

I'm sharing it because most e-commerce leaders I speak with don't know the specifics.

The deadline isn't moving.
The requirements are clear.
The enforcement will be real.

6 months is enough time to prepare - if you start now.

What questions do you have about EAA compliance?

### Post 4: Quick Fixes (Helpful)
```
You can fix 50% of your website's accessibility issues today.

No developers needed. No budget required.

Here are 7 quick wins:

1. ADD ALT TEXT TO IMAGES
- Go through your product images
- Add descriptions: "Blue cotton t-shirt, front view"
- Takes 2 hours for most sites

2. CHECK YOUR COLOR CONTRAST
- Use WebAIM's free contrast checker
- Ensure 4.5:1 ratio for text
- Fix your most-used colors first

3. ADD SKIP LINKS
- Let keyboard users skip to main content
- One line of HTML + CSS
- 15-minute fix

4. LABEL YOUR FORMS
- Every input needs a visible label
- "Email" should be a label, not placeholder text
- Critical for checkout flows

5. TEST WITH KEYBOARD ONLY
- Unplug your mouse
- Can you complete a purchase?
- Note where you get stuck

6. ADD FOCUS INDICATORS
- Visible outline when tabbing through elements
- CSS one-liner: :focus { outline: 2px solid #000; }
- Often accidentally removed by designers

7. CAPTION YOUR VIDEOS
- YouTube auto-captions as a start
- Review and correct errors
- Huge impact for deaf/hard-of-hearing users

These 7 items address the most common EAA violations.

Which one are you tackling first?
