## Long Bio (300 words)

Colin Smith is the founder and CEO of Inclusiv, a technology company on a mission to make digital accessibility achievable for every e-commerce business.

The European Accessibility Act, coming into force in June 2025, requires all e-commerce services operating in the EU to meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards. With an estimated 1.2 million websites affected and industry data suggesting 97% currently fail to comply, Colin identified a massive gap between regulatory requirements and business capabilities.

Inclusiv was born from a simple insight: accessibility shouldn't require a six-figure budget and an army of consultants. The company's AI-powered platform automates the technical complexity of accessibility compliance, scanning websites for issues, prioritising fixes by legal risk and user impact, providing step-by-step remediation guidance, and generating the documentation businesses need to demonstrate compliance.

Colin's journey to accessibility began in the technology and digital commerce sectors, where he repeatedly observed how digital experiences inadvertently exclude millions of users. What struck him wasn't malice — it was oversight. Companies genuinely didn't know they were building barriers, and the expertise to fix the problem was priced out of reach for most businesses.

Beyond Inclusiv, Colin is an advocate for the business case for accessibility. Research consistently shows that accessible websites see higher conversion rates, lower bounce rates, and stronger SEO performance. Colin argues that the EAA isn't just a compliance burden — it's an opportunity for forward-thinking businesses to reach 87 million European customers their competitors are ignoring.
