## Template 1: Breaking News — Deadline Approaching

**Subject Lines (A/B test):**
- 1.2M EU e-commerce sites face accessibility deadline in [X] months
- The June 2025 deadline most online retailers don't know about
- New regulation could shut non-compliant e-commerce sites out of EU

---

**Email:**

Hi [First Name],

I noticed your recent coverage of [relevant article topic] — thought you might be interested in an under-reported story affecting millions of European businesses.

**The hook:** In June 2025, the European Accessibility Act requires all e-commerce sites serving EU customers to meet strict accessibility standards. Industry data suggests 97% of sites currently fail to comply.

The penalties are severe — fines up to €100,000 per violation and potential market removal — yet most retailers I speak with have never heard of the deadline.

I'm the founder of Inclusiv, an AI-powered platform helping e-commerce businesses identify and fix accessibility issues before enforcement begins. We're seeing a surge in panicked inquiries as the deadline approaches.

**I can offer:**
- Data on current compliance rates across EU e-commerce
- Expert commentary on what the regulation means for retailers
- Access to our platform for hands-on testing
- Interviews with retailers scrambling to comply

Would this be relevant for [publication]? Happy to send more details or jump on a quick call.

Best,
Colin Smith

## Template 2: Data Story — Research on EU Site Compliance

**Subject Lines:**
- New data: 97% of EU e-commerce sites fail accessibility standards
- Exclusive research: The state of e-commerce accessibility in Europe
- We scanned 10,000 EU retail sites — here's what we found

---

**Email:**

Hi [First Name],

Your data-driven coverage of [recent article] caught my attention. I have some exclusive research that might interest you.

**The data:** We analysed [X,000] European e-commerce websites for accessibility compliance ahead of the June 2025 EAA deadline. The findings are stark:

- **97%** fail to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards (the legal requirement)
- **83%** have critical issues blocking users with disabilities entirely
- **Average site:** 47 accessibility violations per page
- **Most common issues:** Missing alt text (89%), poor colour contrast (76%), inaccessible forms (71%)

We also broke this down by country, industry sector, and company size — revealing which markets are most at risk.

I'd love to share the full dataset exclusively with [publication] before we release it publicly. This could make a strong standalone piece or complement any EAA coverage you're planning.

Interested in seeing the full research?

Best,
Colin Smith
Founder, Inclusiv

P.S. — The methodology is rigorous. We used automated scanning validated against manual WCAG audits, with a margin of error under 5%.

## Template 3: Founder Story — Why I Built This

**Subject Lines:**
- Why I left [previous role] to fix a problem affecting 87 million Europeans
- The accessibility gap no one's talking about
- Building tech that includes everyone (not just a tagline)

---

**Email:**

Hi [First Name],

I've followed your founder profiles on [publication] — you have a talent for getting to the "why" behind the business. Would love to share mine.

**My story:** I spent years in [tech/e-commerce] watching companies pay lip service to accessibility while 87 million Europeans with disabilities were locked out of online shopping. When the European Accessibility Act passed, I saw an opportunity to actually fix this at scale.

Inclusiv is the result — an AI platform that makes accessibility compliance achievable for any e-commerce business, not just those with six-figure budgets for consultants.

What makes this interesting:
- **The personal angle:** [Optional: any personal connection to disability/accessibility]
- **The market timing:** Building into a regulatory wave (June 2025 deadline)
- **The challenge:** Making "doing the right thing" profitable
- **The bigger picture:** Accessibility as the next frontier of digital inclusion

I'm not just building a compliance tool — I'm trying to change how businesses think about who their customers really are.

Would you be interested in a founder conversation? I'm an open book.

Best,
Colin Smith

## Template 4: Trend Piece — Rise of Accessibility Regulation

**Subject Lines:**
- Accessibility is becoming the new GDPR — here's why
- The regulatory wave retailers aren't ready for
- After privacy, accessibility: The next compliance frontier

---

**Email:**

Hi [First Name],

Your regulatory coverage is always ahead of the curve — wanted to flag a trend I think deserves more attention.

**The trend:** Digital accessibility regulation is going global, and it's about to reshape e-commerce the way GDPR reshaped data practices.

The timeline:
- **June 2025:** EU's European Accessibility Act enforced (1.2M+ sites affected)
- **2025-2026:** US DOJ finalising web accessibility rules under ADA
- **2026+:** UK, Canada, Australia strengthening requirements

Unlike GDPR, most businesses haven't prepared. We're looking at a compliance crisis that could rival the 2018 privacy scramble — but with even less awareness.

**I can provide:**
- Expert analysis on the regulatory landscape across jurisdictions
- Predictions for how enforcement will unfold
- Comparison to GDPR adoption curve
- Commentary from legal and accessibility experts

I'm the founder of Inclusiv (accessibility compliance platform), so I'm deep in this space and happy to be a source — attributed or background.

Worth a conversation?

Best,
Colin Smith

## Template 5: How-To — Quick Fixes for Retailers

**Subject Lines:**
- 5 accessibility fixes any e-commerce site can make today
- The 20% of changes that fix 80% of accessibility issues
- Guest post pitch: Practical EAA compliance for retailers

---

**Email:**

Hi [First Name],

I know [publication] readers are practical people looking for actionable advice. I'd like to pitch a how-to piece that could genuinely help them.

**The pitch:** "5 Accessibility Fixes Any E-commerce Site Can Make Before June 2025"

With the EAA deadline approaching, retailers are overwhelmed by the scope of compliance. But here's what most don't realise: a small number of high-impact fixes can address the majority of accessibility issues.

**Proposed outline:**

1. **Alt text for product images** (fixes 40% of issues, 2-hour implementation)
2. **Colour contrast on CTAs** (fixes conversion AND compliance)
3. **Keyboard navigation for checkout** (the #1 blocker for disabled users)
4. **Form labels and error messages** (often just missing HTML attributes)
5. **Accessible video content** (captions and transcripts)

Each section: problem, solution, implementation steps, tools to use.

I'm Colin Smith, founder of Inclusiv (accessibility compliance platform). I can write this as a contributed piece or work with your team as a source.

Would this fit [publication]'s editorial calendar?
