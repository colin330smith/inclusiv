## New AI Tool Helps EU E-commerce Sites Meet June 2025 Accessibility Deadline

*Inclusiv launches automated accessibility compliance platform as 1.2 million European online retailers face mandatory EAA requirements*

---

**LONDON, UK — January 2026** — Inclusiv, a new accessibility technology company, today announced the launch of its AI-powered platform designed to help e-commerce businesses comply with the European Accessibility Act (EAA), which comes into full force in June 2025.

With an estimated 1.2 million e-commerce sites across the European Union required to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards under the EAA, many retailers are scrambling to understand their obligations and implement necessary changes. Recent industry analysis suggests that up to 97% of e-commerce websites currently fail to meet basic accessibility requirements.

"The accessibility deadline isn't just another compliance checkbox — it represents a fundamental shift in how digital commerce must operate in Europe," said Colin Smith, Founder of Inclusiv. "We built Inclusiv because we saw thousands of well-intentioned businesses that simply didn't know where to start. Our platform gives them a clear path forward."

### Key Features of the Inclusiv Platform:

- **Automated Accessibility Scanning**: AI-powered analysis identifies accessibility issues across entire e-commerce sites in minutes
- **Prioritised Remediation**: Issues ranked by legal risk and user impact, with plain-language fix instructions
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Continuous scanning ensures sites remain compliant as content changes
- **Documentation Generation**: Automated accessibility statements and audit trails for regulatory evidence

### The Regulatory Landscape

The European Accessibility Act (Directive 2019/882) requires all e-commerce services to be accessible to persons with disabilities from June 28, 2025. Non-compliance can result in:

- Fines of up to €100,000 per violation in some member states
- Removal of products/services from EU markets
- Legal action from consumers and advocacy groups
- Reputational damage and lost customer trust

### Market Opportunity

The EU represents a €717 billion e-commerce market, with approximately 87 million Europeans living with some form of disability. Accessible websites have been shown to increase conversion rates by up to 20% and reduce bounce rates significantly.

"Accessibility isn't just about compliance — it's about reaching customers that competitors are ignoring," Smith added. "The businesses that embrace accessibility now will have a significant competitive advantage."

### Availability and Pricing

Inclusiv is available immediately with plans starting at €99/month for small e-commerce sites. Enterprise pricing is available for larger retailers and agencies managing multiple properties.
