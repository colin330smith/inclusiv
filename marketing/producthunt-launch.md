## 3. DESCRIPTION (500-600 words)

### The Accessibility Deadline That Could Cost You Everything

On **June 28, 2025**, the European Accessibility Act (EAA) becomes enforceable. If you sell to EU customers and your website isn't accessible, you're facing fines up to **€100,000**, potential market bans, and legal action from 87 million Europeans with disabilities.

Most e-commerce businesses don't even know this deadline exists. The ones that do are overwhelmed by 50-page WCAG documents, expensive consultants charging €10,000+ for audits, and accessibility tools that take weeks to implement.

**We built Inclusiv to solve this.**

### What is Inclusiv?

Inclusiv is an AI-powered accessibility scanner built specifically for EU e-commerce compliance. Enter your URL, and in under 30 seconds you'll know:

- Your current EAA compliance score (0-100)
- Exactly which accessibility issues put you at legal risk
- The specific code fixes to resolve each issue
- Priority ranking so you fix critical problems first

No signup required. No credit card. Just instant, actionable results.

**Try it free:** https://inclusiv-xi.vercel.app

### Why We Built This

After scanning over **500 EU e-commerce sites**, we discovered something alarming: the average accessibility score is just **62/100**. That means most online stores are at serious legal risk and don't know it.

The accessibility industry has been gatekept for too long. Enterprise tools cost thousands. Consultants speak in jargon. WCAG guidelines read like legal contracts. Meanwhile, small and medium businesses—the backbone of EU commerce—are left scrambling as the deadline approaches.

Inclusiv democratizes accessibility compliance. We believe every business, regardless of size, deserves to:
1. Understand their current compliance status instantly
2. Get specific, implementable fixes (not vague recommendations)
3. Protect themselves from legal action without hiring expensive consultants

### What Makes Inclusiv Different

**Instant Results:** No waiting days for audit reports. Scan completes in under 30 seconds.

**Code Fixes Included:** We don't just identify problems—we provide the exact HTML, CSS, and ARIA fixes. Copy, paste, comply.

**EAA-Focused:** Built specifically for the European Accessibility Act, not generic accessibility guidelines. Every scan evaluates against the actual requirements that matter for EU compliance.

**Free Core Scanner:** The essential scan is completely free. We believe knowing your compliance status shouldn't be behind a paywall when the deadline is this close.

**Priority Scoring:** Not all issues are equal. We rank by legal risk so you fix what matters first.

### The Clock is Ticking

167 days. That's how long EU e-commerce businesses have to achieve compliance before enforcement begins.

Some businesses will ignore this until it's too late. Some will panic-buy expensive solutions that don't work. The smart ones will take 30 seconds today to understand exactly where they stand.

**Scan your site free:** https://inclusiv-xi.vercel.app

We're here to help every EU business become accessible—not because they have to, but because 87 million potential customers deserve equal access to online commerce.

## 4. FIRST COMMENT (From Maker)

**Posted by:** Colin Smith (Maker)

---

Hey ProductHunt! Colin here, the maker of Inclusiv.

**Why I built this:**

167 days. That's all the time EU e-commerce businesses have before the European Accessibility Act becomes enforceable on June 28, 2025.

I started researching this after a friend who runs a small online shop in Germany asked me: "I keep hearing about this accessibility law—should I be worried?"

The answer scared me.

Fines up to €100,000. Potential bans from selling to EU customers. Legal exposure to 87 million Europeans with disabilities. And when I looked at the tools available to help? Enterprise-priced scanners. Consultants charging €10K+ for audits. 50-page WCAG documents written for lawyers, not business owners.

So I did what any developer would do—I started scanning sites myself.

**What I found:**

After scanning 500+ EU e-commerce sites, the average accessibility score was just 62/100. These aren't obscure shops. These are businesses processing thousands of orders, completely unaware they're at legal risk.

The most common issues?
- Missing alt text on product images (70% of sites)
- Poor color contrast on "Add to Cart" buttons (58%)
- Forms that screen readers can't navigate (45%)
- No keyboard navigation support (40%)

These are fixable problems. Most take less than an hour with the right guidance.

**What Inclusiv does differently:**

1. **Instant results** - Scan completes in ~30 seconds
2. **Actual code fixes** - Not "improve your color contrast." We give you the exact CSS.
3. **EAA-specific** - Built for this deadline, not generic accessibility
4. **Free core scan** - Knowing your risk shouldn't cost money

**I'm here all day to answer questions:**
- Technical questions about EAA requirements
- How we generate fixes
- Accessibility best practices
- Anything else!

If you're selling to EU customers, take 30 seconds to scan your site. The deadline won't wait.

## 5. HUNTER OUTREACH TEMPLATES

### Template 1: For Tech/SaaS-Focused Hunters

**Subject:** Hunting a time-sensitive EU compliance tool?

---

Hey [Hunter Name],

I've been following your hunts—your eye for products that solve real, urgent problems is impressive. [Reference a specific recent hunt they did].

I built something that fits that criteria: **Inclusiv**, a free AI accessibility scanner for EU e-commerce.

Here's the urgency: The European Accessibility Act becomes enforceable June 28, 2025. Fines up to €100,000. After scanning 500+ EU sites, I found the average compliance score is just 62/100—most businesses don't even know they're at risk.

Inclusiv scans any site in 30 seconds and provides actual code fixes, not vague recommendations. Free to use, no signup required.

Would you be interested in hunting this? The deadline-driven narrative and clear value prop could resonate well with the PH community.

Happy to send over assets, demo access, or answer any questions.

Best,
Colin

### Template 2: For Hunters Focused on Tools/Utilities

**Subject:** Free tool with a 167-day countdown

---

Hi [Hunter Name],

Loved your recent hunt of [Product]. The way you framed the problem-solution made it compelling.

I have a tool with built-in urgency: **Inclusiv** - an AI accessibility scanner with a hard deadline.

June 28, 2025: EU's European Accessibility Act enforcement begins. Non-compliant e-commerce sites face fines up to €100,000. After researching this space, I found most businesses either don't know about the law or can't afford the €10K+ audits to check compliance.

Inclusiv solves this:
- Free instant scan (30 seconds)
- Specific code fixes included
- EAA-focused scoring

167 days until the deadline. Would you be open to hunting this? I think the time pressure combined with the free utility angle could drive strong engagement.

Let me know—happy to provide everything you need.

Cheers,
Colin

### Template 3: For High-Volume/Diverse Hunters

**Subject:** Quick question about hunting a compliance tool

---

[Hunter Name],

You've hunted some great products this year. Quick question: would a free EU accessibility scanner be in your wheelhouse?

**The context:** European Accessibility Act enforcement starts June 28, 2025. €100K fines for non-compliance. I scanned 500+ EU e-commerce sites—average score was 62/100.

**The tool:** Inclusiv scans any site in 30 seconds, shows EAA compliance score, and provides actual code fixes. Completely free, no signup.

I'm looking for a hunter who understands the "deadline creates urgency" angle. The story writes itself: small businesses about to get blindsided by a law they don't know about, and a free tool that helps them in 30 seconds.

If this sounds interesting, I'd love to chat. If not, no worries—appreciate your time either way.

Best,
Colin

## Key Messages to Reinforce

Throughout all materials, consistently reinforce:

1. **The deadline is real:** June 28, 2025 is not flexible
2. **The risk is significant:** €100,000 fines, market bans
3. **The solution is instant:** 30 seconds, not weeks
4. **It's free:** No barrier to checking your status
5. **It's actionable:** Code fixes, not vague advice

---

## Talking Points for Comments/Q&A

**If asked about accuracy:**
"We validate against EAA requirements and WCAG 2.1 AA standards. While no automated tool catches 100% of issues, we identify the most common and highest-risk problems that affect legal compliance."

**If asked about pricing/business model:**
"Core scanning is free forever. We'll offer premium features like monitoring, team collaboration, and priority support for businesses that want ongoing compliance management."

**If asked how this is different from WAVE/axe/etc:**
"Great tools! The difference is EAA-specific focus—we prioritize based on what matters for EU legal compliance, and we provide actual code fixes, not just issue identification."

**If asked about competitors:**
"We're not competing with enterprise accessibility consultants—we're filling the gap for the millions of small businesses who can't afford €10K audits but still need to comply."
