## Technology Integration Email Templates

### Template 1: WordPress Plugin Integration

**Subject Lines (A/B test):**
- "Integration partnership: [Their Plugin] + Inclusiv"
- "Expanding accessibility coverage for WordPress users"
- "API integration opportunity - EAA compliance"

```
Hi [First Name],

I've been following [Their Plugin/Company]'s work on WordPress accessibility, and I wanted to reach out about a potential integration partnership.

We're building Inclusiv—an AI-powered accessibility scanning platform specifically for e-commerce sites facing the European Accessibility Act deadline (June 28, 2025). We're seeing massive demand from EU businesses who need WCAG 2.1 AA compliance fast.

**Integration Opportunity:**

Our platforms could complement each other nicely:
- [Their Plugin] handles [their specialty - e.g., content accessibility]
- Inclusiv handles automated WCAG scanning + monitoring

Together, we could offer WordPress users a more complete accessibility solution.

**What I'm proposing:**

1. API integration to share scan results/recommendations
2. Co-marketing to our respective user bases
3. Mutual referral arrangement for complementary use cases

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to explore if there's a fit? We're actively building integrations with leading WordPress accessibility tools.

Best,
Colin

### Template 2: Accessibility Platform Partnership

**For: accessiBe, AudioEye, UserWay, Eye-Able**

**Subject Lines:**
- "Coopetition opportunity: complementary accessibility coverage"
- "API partnership inquiry from Inclusiv"
- "E-commerce accessibility gap - potential partnership"

```
Hi [Partnership Team],

I'm reaching out from Inclusiv—we're building automated accessibility compliance specifically for e-commerce platforms facing the EAA deadline.

I noticed [Their Platform] has strong coverage in [their specialty], while our focus is specifically on:
- Deep e-commerce workflow scanning (checkout, cart, product pages)
- EU regulatory compliance documentation
- Automated fix suggestions for Shopify/WooCommerce/Magento

**Partnership Concept:**

Rather than compete head-on, I think there's an interesting coopetition angle:

1. **Technical Integration**: API to share scan results, avoid duplicate work
2. **Market Segmentation**: You handle [their strength], we handle e-commerce compliance
3. **Referral Exchange**: Send each other customers based on best fit

We're finding that e-commerce sites have unique accessibility challenges (dynamic pricing, cart flows, payment integrations) that generic scanners miss. Meanwhile, we don't cover [their specialty areas].

Would your partnerships team be open to exploring this? I'd love to schedule a call to discuss the technical and business fit.

Best regards,
Colin Smith

### Template 3: Platform/CMS Integration

**For: Shopify App Partners, Webflow Tools, WooCommerce Extensions**

**Subject Lines:**
- "New accessibility app/integration for [Platform] ecosystem"
- "EAA compliance tool - partnership for [Platform] users"
- "Integration inquiry: accessibility scanning for [Platform]"

```
Hi [First Name],

With the European Accessibility Act deadline hitting in [X months], every [Platform] merchant selling to EU customers needs WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. Most don't know where to start.

We built Inclusiv to solve this—automated accessibility scanning designed specifically for e-commerce.

**For [Platform] users, this means:**
- One-click scanning from their admin panel
- E-commerce-specific accessibility checks
- Prioritized fix recommendations
- Ongoing compliance monitoring
- EAA regulatory documentation

**Partnership opportunity:**

We're looking for partners in the [Platform] ecosystem to help us reach merchants who need this solution before June 2025.

Options we've offered other partners:
- White-label (your branding, our technology)
- Referral program (20% recurring revenue share)
- Integration partnership (embed our scanner in your app)

I'd love to discuss what would work best for [Their Company]. Quick 15-minute call this week?

Best,
Colin

## Reseller Agreement Email Templates

### Template 4: Agency Reseller Partnership

**For: Agencies who want to resell at their margin**

**Subject Lines:**
- "[Agency Name]: wholesale pricing for accessibility services"
- "40% wholesale discount - accessibility compliance"
- "Add €50K+ ARR: reseller partnership"

```
Hi [First Name],

I'll get straight to the point: [Agency Name] could add accessibility compliance as a service line—with zero development, starting today.

**Here's the reseller deal:**

- 40% wholesale discount on all Inclusiv plans
- You set your own client pricing (typical markup: 50-100%)
- White-label reports with your branding
- We handle the technology, you own the relationship

**Quick math:**

| Your Clients | Wholesale Cost | Typical Client Price | Your Monthly Profit |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 10 clients | €1,194/mo | €2,990/mo | €1,796/mo |
| 25 clients | €2,985/mo | €7,475/mo | €4,490/mo |
| 50 clients | €5,970/mo | €14,950/mo | €8,980/mo |

With the EAA deadline in [X months], your clients need this anyway. Question is whether you sell it or someone else does.

Interested? I can send over the reseller agreement and set up your wholesale account this week.

Best,
Colin
Inclusiv

### Template 5: White-Label Technology Partner

**For: Larger agencies wanting full brand ownership**

**Subject Lines:**
- "White-label accessibility scanner for [Agency Name]"
- "Your brand, our technology: accessibility compliance"
- "[Agency Name] Accessibility Scanner - powered by us"

```
Hi [First Name],

What if [Agency Name] had its own branded accessibility scanner—without building anything?

**White-Label Package:**

✓ scanner.[agency].com - your domain
✓ Full brand removal - 100% your logo/colors
✓ Client management dashboard
✓ API access for custom integrations
✓ Priority support
✓ Co-branded marketing materials

**Pricing:**

- Base platform: €2,997/year
- Per-scan pricing: €0.50/page (volume discounts available)
- No revenue sharing - keep 100% of what you charge

**Current white-label partners are charging:**

- €499/site/year for compliance scanning
- €149/month for ongoing monitoring
- €2,500+ for one-time audits

With 20+ clients, you'd break even in month one. Everything after that is profit.

I'd love to show you the white-label demo and discuss custom pricing. Free for a call this week?

Best regards,
Colin Smith
Inclusiv | White-Label Accessibility Solutions

## Follow-Up Sequences

### Technology Partner Follow-Up

**Day 3:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Following up on my integration partnership note. I'd love to schedule a quick technical call to explore the API fit between our platforms.

We're prioritizing integrations this quarter and have dev resources allocated. If there's interest, now's the time.

Worth a 15-minute call?

Colin
```

**Day 7:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Last note from me on this—just wanted to share that we've recently integrated with [similar partner] and are seeing great results for mutual customers.

If [Their Company] ever wants to explore something similar, the door's open.

Best,
Colin
```

### Reseller Partner Follow-Up

**Day 3:**
```
Quick follow-up, [First Name].

I realized I didn't ask—how is [Agency Name] currently handling accessibility requests from clients?

If you're outsourcing or turning them away, the reseller program might be worth a 10-minute look.

Happy to share case studies from similar agencies.

Colin
```

**Day 7:**
```
Hi [First Name],

[X days] until the EAA deadline. Are your EU-facing clients prepared?

If accessibility compliance isn't currently in [Agency Name]'s service offering, our reseller program is the fastest way to add it (40% wholesale, white-label reports, zero development).

Let me know if a quick call would be helpful.

Colin
```
