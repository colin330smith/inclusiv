### What is WCAG 2.1 AA?

**WCAG** stands for **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines**. These are internationally recognized standards developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to ensure web content is accessible to people with disabilities.

**WCAG 2.1 AA** is the current standard level that most regulations require, including:
- The European Accessibility Act (EAA)
- The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
- Section 508 in the US
- Various national accessibility laws worldwide

The "AA" level means your website must meet both A (basic) and AA (intermediate) success criteria, covering:
- **Perceivable**: Content can be perceived by all users (alt text, captions, contrast)
- **Operable**: Interface can be operated by all users (keyboard navigation, no seizure triggers)
- **Understandable**: Content is understandable (readable text, predictable navigation)
- **Robust**: Content works with assistive technologies (screen readers, voice control)

---

### What is the EAA deadline?

The **European Accessibility Act (EAA)** comes into full enforcement on **June 28, 2025**.

After this date, businesses that:
- Sell products or services to EU customers
- Operate websites accessible from EU countries
- Provide digital services in the EU market

Must ensure their digital products and services are accessible. Non-compliance can result in:
- Fines up to €100,000+ per violation
- Legal action from consumers and advocacy groups
- Removal from EU market access
- Reputational damage

**Don't wait** - scan your website now and start fixing issues before the deadline.

3. **Impact Level**: Critical, Warning, or Notice
4. **Fix Recommendation**: Step-by-step instructions to resolve the issue
